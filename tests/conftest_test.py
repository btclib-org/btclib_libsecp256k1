"""Tests for the coverage threshold `conftest.py` hands each run.

The run that reaches that hook with a subset selected is, by
construction, not the run that measures this file: a suite gated at 100%
is a whole run, and what the hook does to a partial one is invisible to
it. So the decision is driven here as a function, over the namespace
pytest's own parser fills in.

The position of `--cov` in `addopts` is here for the same reason -- it
is a property of a command line no run of that command line can report
on. `--cov` last swallows the first path the command line gives, and
what the swallowed path becomes is coverage's `source`: a module name
nothing imports, so the run collects nothing and reports zero against a
floor of 100.

The guard beside it is driven the same way, with one exception: the run
it refuses cannot be the run reporting on it either, so the case it
exists for is taken in a subprocess started from `tests/`.
