"""zkp's own libsecp256k1 context, and what it reports through it.

Mirrors `btclib_secp256k1.context`, one library over: two statically
linked cores share nothing at run time, which is what makes this
necessary rather than a convenience. `context.py`'s own docstring has
the reasoning `ctx` and `check` repeat here -- a shared context,
randomized once at creation, and a thread-local pair of callbacks that
`check` raises what was last reported through. A call made through
zkp's `lib` is explained by zkp's `check`, never by the primary
package's: two libraries reporting into one thread-local would
attribute one library's message to a call the other library made.

Building either needs the extension `btclib_secp256k1.zkp` loads on
first access to `ffi` or `lib`, so `ctx` is read the same lazy way here:
a module-level `__getattr__` builds it, and the context, on first
access, rather than at import of this module. That keeps
`import btclib_secp256k1.zkp.context` on its own safe without the flag
-- which is what lets docs/source/btclib_secp256k1.rst document this
module's own docstring, the documentation build never setting
`BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP`.

`_bindings` below is the one place every module wrapping a zkp-only
entry point (#607 onward) reaches for `ffi`, `lib` and `ctx` together:
each such module defers the three to its own first call rather than to
its own top level, for the reason this module's `__getattr__` already
states for `ctx` alone, and `_bindings` is that deferral made once,
here, instead of once per module. Called through `context._bindings()`
rather than copied, so that a fifth wrapper module takes on no ordering
requirement of its own -- reading `ctx` first, as this module's
`__getattr__` already does, is what makes `ffi` and `lib` real, and a
caller of `_bindings` never reads either before that has happened.

Deferred to the first call is also what the primary package's own
`context.py` is not: that one builds at plain module scope, which
Python's own import lock serializes -- every thread importing it blocks
on the same lock, and one of them runs the module body while the rest
wait for the result already sitting in `sys.modules`. Nothing here
imports the extension at module scope, by decision, so nothing plays
that part for `_load` below: two threads whose first touch of `ctx`
overlaps both pass its `"ctx" not in globals()` check before either has
written anything, and both build a context, `README.md`'s Thread safety
section's own guarantee -- "it runs once before any thread exists" --
holding only of the sequential path (#717). `_lock` is what `_load`
takes instead, held for the whole build and rechecked once acquired: a
thread that waited for it finds `ctx` already there and returns that
one, never a second context built to be discarded.
