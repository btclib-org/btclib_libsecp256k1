r"""Re-check every vendored-vector pin against upstream, weekly.

tests/README.md pins each vendored vector to a commit and a git blob
SHA-1, with a documented manual procedure to re-check one.
This automates that procedure and reports drift, rather than fixing it:
refreshing a vector file is a decision this script does not get to
make, so what it opens is an issue, never a commit. Ported from a
sibling repository's own check_vendored_vectors.py, which this
package's README convention matches by design.

Scope is narrower than the README could need, though nothing in this
project's own entries reaches the narrower part: only
an entry whose `behind` already reads 0 -- what a human last confirmed
was exactly at upstream's tip -- is checked. An entry already
documented as behind would be a decision already made, and
re-reporting the same gap every week would be noise rather than news;
a sibling repository's own README carries that shape and this one
does not.

A path upstream has renamed or deleted is reported rather than raising:
it has no commit to name as a tip, and a pin standing on a file that is
not there any more is the one drift nobody would otherwise notice.

Two more shapes this script does not attempt, for the same reason the
sibling script does not, present or not in this project's own README
today: a path carrying a `<name>` placeholder, where one pin serves several
files at once, and an entry with no `commit` at all. A heading owning no
fenced block of its own is a third, and different in kind from the other
two: there is no block to read a field out of, so it is listed under its
own reason rather than folded into "no commit to check against" --
whether it is a group heading a finer one supersedes, or a pin whose
block an edit broke, is not for this script to tell apart, only to
report by name. Every heading the README carries but this script did not
check is listed in its own report, so nothing silently reads as "checked
and clean" that was not checked at all.

The sibling copy also collapses skip lines that repeat one heading and
one reason, a shape that only a heading owning several fenced blocks
can produce. tests/README.md gives every heading here exactly one
block, so no skip line this script builds ever repeats today -- a
property of this file, not a shape the parsing above forbids, and not
carried here for that reason.

The issue title is the caller's, which is what the copies owe each
other: the sibling repository passes two ledgers through one script --
a pin behind upstream and a verdict read at a revision that has moved
are different news, acted on differently -- so a title fixed in the
module would name one issue for the pair, each run rewriting what the
other wrote. One ledger passes through this copy, so the argument buys
nothing here on its own; it is taken because a caller's argument list
is the half of the two files that is meant to stay identical. What
answers to the sibling's own two-ledger shape is not taken:
`readme_path` keeps its name, this tree calling that file a README
everywhere else it names it.
