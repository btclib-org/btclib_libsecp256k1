"""A hook's pins are what `uv.lock` resolves, wherever it resolves them.

The type gate runs in an environment of its own: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
gives the mirror a `rev` and a list of `additional_dependencies`, and
pre-commit builds that environment once and keeps it. The editor cannot
use it -- this package is a compiled extension and the import does not
resolve where nothing built one -- so what the editor reads is the
project environment instead, and the two are the same mypy only while the
two declarations say the same thing.

Nothing made them say it. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` records that they are
"moved by hand, with the lint and test groups of uv.lock", which is a
procedure rather than a check, and section 4 of the organization standard
names that second declaration as the price of this branch. This module is
what turns the procedure into a red test: a `uv lock` that moves one of
these and a hand that does not follow is the whole of what it catches,
and it is silent -- both environments still build, and mypy still passes
in each, against different versions.

That procedure is about a hand-moved pin rather than about mypy, so every
`additional_dependencies` pin in the file is read here and asserted
against the lock wherever the lock resolves its package
(btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#779). Where it does not, the pin is the only
declaration there is and nothing can disagree with it: `uv.lock` resolves
neither `shellcheck-py` nor `typos`, each being a tool installed for one
hook and declared by no dependency group, and a pin absent from the lock
is left alone rather than failed. The mypy block keeps the stronger
reading of the two, `test_every_mypy_pin_is_one_the_lock_resolves` below
requiring each of its pins to be in the lock at all: they are what the
checked files import, and the project installs those.

Parsed rather than loaded. `uv.lock` is toml and the floor here is 3.10,
where `tomllib` is not yet in the standard library, which is the reason
`copyright_test.py` beside this one reads pyproject.toml the same way;
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` is yaml and no group here carries a parser for
it. Three shapes are narrow enough to match: a `[[package]]` table with a
name and a version, and the two this file writes an
`additional_dependencies` value in -- a bracketed list on the key's own
line, and `- ` items indented under it.

A value is read whole or not at all. The comma separates a flow
sequence's items in yaml and a specifier set's clauses in PEP 440, so
the split that reads the first has to know where a quoted scalar begins
and ends, and the set that survives the split is read as one thing
rather than as text around an `==`. An item the walk still cannot
resolve into a requirement makes the whole value nothing, which
`test_every_additional_dependencies_key_was_read` fails on rather than
asserting the pins beside it while the rest goes unread.
