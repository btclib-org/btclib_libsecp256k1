"""Build the vendored libsecp256k1 and the cffi extension over it.

Three build paths, and which one runs is decided by the environment
rather than by an argument: static with MSVC on native Windows, static
with the interpreter's own toolchain everywhere else, and dynamic (cffi
ABI mode) where no C is compiled at all. `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_DYNAMIC`
picks the third, `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_CROSS_COMPILE` forces it for a
target whose interpreter cannot be run here, and `CFFI_PLATFORM` names
the platform being built for when it is not the one running.

A fourth, orthogonal thing the environment decides:
`BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP=true` builds a second extension,
`_btclib_secp256k1_zkp`, over the vendored secp256k1-zkp submodule --
static only, `Secp256k1ZkpCFFIExtension`'s own docstring has the reason.
The comparison below is against that literal, so every other value
leaves the fourth path off exactly as no value at all does: nothing
about the three paths above changes, `ffi_ext_zkp` below is `None`, and
`scripts/hatch_build.py` never calls into this module a second time.

Three classes: `FFIExtension` is the shape of a build with the three
steps a subclass has to answer; `VendoredCMakeExtension` is what this
project's two extensions share -- the CMake invocation, the
architecture and deployment-target options, and the header-to-cdef
derivation, none of which depends on which of the two submodules is
being built; `Secp256k1CFFIExtension` and `Secp256k1ZkpCFFIExtension`
are the two of them, differing only in which submodule they read, which
of its modules they turn on, and which of its headers the cdef comes
from. scripts/README.md walks the file; the module is also loaded by
`exec()` from scripts/hatch_build.py, which is why nothing here depends
on being importable.

        Also decides whether this build is static: the dynamic path is
        asked for by environment variable, and cross-compilation forces
        it, the target's interpreter not being runnable here. This is a

        of which submodule is being built, so it is set the same way for

                order that satisfies their `#include` dependencies --
                stripped before preprocessing, so the list order is what
                still expresses them.
            module_flags: the `-DSECP256K1_ENABLE_MODULE_*` CMake
                arguments this submodule's modules are turned on or off
                with, explicit rather than left to upstream's own
                defaults, which are not part of its API.
            extra_clean_patterns: glob patterns, beyond the extension's
                own name, that a previous build of this extension alone
                may have left behind. Empty for a submodule whose build

        instead defaults to the one of the host. That is the same thing
        only as long as the two agree, and on Windows arm64 they need not:
        uv installs an emulated x86-64 CPython there by default (native
        aarch64 "is not yet mature"), and MSVC then compiles the extension
        for x86-64 against an arm64 archive, leaving every secp256k1
        symbol unresolved at link time (LNK2001). The macOS counterparts
        are an x86-64 interpreter under Rosetta, and the universal2 one of
        the python.org installer, which compiles for both architectures
        and so needs both in the archive it links.

        sysconfig.get_platform() is where setuptools reads its own target
        from, so deriving this from it keeps the two in agreement by
        construction; on POSIX it also follows the _PYTHON_HOST_PLATFORM
        that a cross-compiling cibuildwheel sets, so an arm64 macOS wheel
        built on an Intel runner is built for arm64 throughout.

        Linux has no equivalent option to set: a 32-bit interpreter on a

        `build_c` runs for both linkages, but only a static build feeds
        its result into a second, separate toolchain:
        `compile_static_unix` links CMake's own archive into an
        extension compiled by the interpreter's own `cc`, whose CFLAGS
        already carry `-mmacosx-version-min`. Where nothing sets
        `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, CMake compiles that archive for
        whatever the build machine runs, and `ld` warns on every member
        of it built newer than the extension's own floor
        (btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#526). A dynamic build compiles
        nothing this extension links against -- the shared object it
        produces is `dlopen`ed at import, by a process whose own
        toolchain never touches it -- so guarding to `self.static` is
        what keeps this from reaching that path at all, leaving
        `dynamic_platform_tag`'s own coupling between the environment
        variable and the library CMake builds (see scripts/README.md)
        untouched.

        Where `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is already exported --
        `cibuildwheel` sets it itself for every static release wheel --
        that value is left to CMake's own initialization of
        `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` from the environment, and nothing
        is returned here: an explicit `-D` on the configure's command
        line would instead define the cache entry unconditionally,
        ahead of and regardless of that initialization, so passing one
        derived from `sysconfig` whenever `cibuildwheel`'s own is also
        present would silently override it rather than agree with it.
        `sysconfig.get_config_var` -- fixed at interpreter-build time,
        unmoved by what the calling process's environment holds -- is
        read only as the fallback for the unexported case, which is
        what a bare `uv build --wheel` is and what
        btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#526 was filed against. Deferring
        this way is not exhaustive: an export that disagrees with the
        interpreter's own floor still reaches CMake unchallenged, and
        the warning this closes can still fire -- measured with
        `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.0` against an 11.0 interpreter.

    side by side, so `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP` declines rather than
    shipping a second one -- raising here, before any CMake or cffi work
    starts, rather than letting the dynamic path build something nobody
    asked for (btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#603, #605).

    Every module secp256k1-zkp defines is turned on, not the modules
    beyond mainline's own alone: #603 measured trimming the shared ones
    (ecdh, recovery, ellswift, musig) at 85 KB of a 1.5 MB library, and
    zkp's own musig -- the adaptor-capable one, a superset of mainline's
    -- is needed regardless. silentpayments is the sync's, the pinned
    commit merging BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp#368, and upstream's
    own default is what turns it on rather than a flag below; the header
    list leaves it out where `Secp256k1CFFIExtension`'s does not, so it
    is compiled and linked with none of its entry points declared to
    cffi. The fork's copy of that module is mainline's blob for blob at
    the commit the other extension builds, and that one declares and
    wraps it.
