"""Tests for the sdist-exclude check of `.github/scripts`.

The check is a pre-commit hook, so what it says about the real tree is
answered on every commit, by the hook itself: there is deliberately no
test that the real tree passes it. What cannot be answered that way is
how it behaves against an exclude list that does what
btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#655 describes -- an entry matching a file a
submodule tracks -- because a tree in that state is a tree the gate
refuses. Those cases are built by hand, alongside `/COPYRIGHT`'s own
deliberate case, which the real tree carries today and which the check
has to stay quiet about.

One test does read the real `pyproject.toml`: the canary asserting that
`sdist_exclude_patterns` returns exactly what `tomllib` reads out of
the same file. That is not the hook's own question -- it asks whether
the walk is still reading the array TOML says is there, which is the
one thing a hook matching a substituted pattern set could not report.
`tomllib` is 3.11 and this package's floor is 3.10, which is why the
script parses by hand and why the canary is `importorskip`ped rather
than written into the script.

The script is loaded by path, `.github/scripts` being no package, and
once: `monkeypatch` undoes what each test does to it.
