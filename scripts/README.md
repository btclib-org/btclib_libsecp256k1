# scripts

The build backend of this package. Nothing here is
part of the installed package: `btclib_secp256k1` never imports these
modules, and they carry no public API. They are, however, shipped in the
sdist, because building it from source runs two of them.

Ruff exempts this directory from the docstring rules (`D`) and grants the
`subprocess` and `exec` allowances that driving a C build requires; the
exemptions are listed, one file at a time, under
`tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores` in `pyproject.toml`.

## hatch_build.py

The hatchling build hook, registered as
`tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.hooks.custom`. It runs on the wheel
target only: an sdist is pure sources, and building one must not compile
anything.

It removes `build/` wholesale before starting, so that no artifact of a
previous configuration (static or dynamic, host or cross) survives into
the wheel, then loads each entry of its own `cffi_modules` setting and
compiles it. The description is a module of this repository, so it is run
by `exec()` rather than imported: the build backend then needs no import
path setup for a package that is not installed yet.

`pyproject.toml` names two entries, `ffi_ext` and `ffi_ext_zkp`, and the
second is unconditional there: a static file has no
`BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP` to read, so the entry is always present and
`cffi_build.py` is what decides, at exec time, whether it resolves to an
extension or to `None`. A `None` entry is skipped -- no artifact, no
mode -- rather than built, which is what lets the flag turn the fourth
path on and off without a second `pyproject.toml`.

What it does with the result:

- every artifact is `force_include`d at the wheel root, next to the
  package, which is where `btclib_secp256k1/__init__.py` looks for it
- the wheel tag is set from the extension mode: `infer_tag` for a static
  extension, which is ABI-specific, and an explicit
  `py3-none-<platform>` for a dynamic one, which is not
- an editable install never reads either: hatchling's own
  `WheelBuilder.build_editable_detection` and `build_editable_explicit`
  decide the tag from `self.get_default_tag()` regardless, so the hook
  rebinds that method on the live builder to the same decision above,
  which is the one call both editable paths make in its place.
  `tests/extension_test.py` reads the installed distribution's own
  `WHEEL` back, on every build the suite runs, and fails if its tag
  is ever the universal one this rebind exists to avoid
- a wheel mixing both modes raises, and so does one with no extension at
  all. Neither can arise from the configurations CI builds, which is the
  argument for refusing them rather than for reporting them: nothing
  downstream inspects a wheel's tag against its contents, so a `py3-none`
  wheel carrying a `cpNN` extension would install on any interpreter of
  the platform and fail to import on most of them

`dynamic_platform_tag()` is the one place that has to name the target
platform itself, since a dynamic wheel gets no tag from the interpreter
that built it. On Linux the tag it produces is a plain `linux_*`, which
`auditwheel repair` later upgrades to a manylinux one. On macOS it reads
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, and falls back to `platform.mac_ver()` when
nothing set one — which is honest, CMake having built the library for
that same host default, and narrow: the wheel is then one only the build
machine's macOS accepts. Every wheel that ships is built with the
variable exported, by `test.yml` for the dynamic ones and by
`cibuildwheel` for the static ones; a local build reproducing either has
to export it too, and CONTRIBUTING.md says so where it gives the
command.

## cffi_build.py

The cffi build description named in `cffi_modules`, exposing the two
objects the hook picks up: `ffi_ext`, always an extension, and
`ffi_ext_zkp`, an extension or `None` depending on
`BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP`. `VendoredCMakeExtension` is what the two
share -- everything below but the headers, the enabled CMake modules and
the submodule read, which `Secp256k1CFFIExtension` and
`Secp256k1ZkpCFFIExtension` each name their own of, through the
`configure()` call their `__init__` makes. Three stages, in order.

**Build the vendored library.** CMake, on every platform, out of tree
into `build/<submodule>`: the submodule is only ever read from. The
configure line names every module its submodule declares an option for,
rather than relying on upstream defaults, which are not part of
upstream's API and which answer in both directions: `recovery` is off by
default in both submodules, and `silentpayments` is on by default in
secp256k1-zkp, whose extension declares none of that module's entry
points to cffi. So `ecdh`, `recovery`, `extrakeys`, `schnorrsig`,
`musig`, `ellswift`, `silentpayments` for the primary extension, and
every module secp256k1-zkp defines for the flagged one, `silentpayments`
`OFF` and the rest `ON` (btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#792).
`tests/module_flags_test.py` compares each list against its submodule's
`CMakeLists.txt` and fails where a module is named in one and not the
other; which value a named module carries is the configure line's to
state, and no test here holds it. `SECP256K1_VALGRIND` is named for a
different reason: it is pinned `OFF` because its default answers with
the build machine rather than with a value — `AUTO` is
`find_package(Valgrind)`, so a runner that happens to have the header
ships a library compiled with `-DVALGRIND`, which is a wheel this
repository cannot tell from any other. Upstream's own tests, benchmarks
and install rules are all turned off. A stale CMake cache is deleted
first, because it remembers the previous configuration.

The build also replaces libsecp256k1's default callbacks, which
`abort()`, with do-nothing ones, so that an illegal input can never take
the hosting Python process down. Those are compiled as a separate unit
and attached to the library target through `CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE` and a
deferred `target_sources` call; both the stub source and the CMake
fragment are written into the binary directory, so the vendored tree
stays untouched. These are only the defaults, applying to contexts whose
callbacks are unset — the shared context of the bindings installs its
own, which is how `context.check()` can raise what was reported. Both
submodules support the same option, so this reaches secp256k1-zkp's own
build the same way.

**Derive the cdef.** The public headers are concatenated in dependency
order — `#include` directives are stripped before preprocessing, so the
order of the list is load-bearing — and run through `gcc -E` with
`__attribute__(x)=` defined away, which cffi cannot parse. A `gcc` on
PATH is therefore required even on Windows, where MSVC compiles the
extension. The stripping pattern allows whitespace between `#` and
`include`: three of secp256k1-zkp's own headers spell their include of
`secp256k1.h` that way, where every header of the primary submodule
spells it `#include`.

**Compile the extension**, by one of three paths:

- static on Windows: the standard setuptools/MSVC toolchain, with
  `SECP256K1_STATIC` selecting the static-consumer declarations
- static elsewhere: `emit_c_code()`, then an explicit compile and link
  with the interpreter's own `CC`, `CCSHARED` and `LDSHARED`
- dynamic: no C is compiled at all. `emit_python_code()` writes the ABI
  mode module, and the shared libsecp256k1 is copied next to it — found
  by searching every candidate directory CMake may have used, skipping
  the versioned names of a symlink chain

`Secp256k1ZkpCFFIExtension.__init__` raises before any of the three
where `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP=true` is passed alongside
`BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_DYNAMIC=true` or
`BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_CROSS_COMPILE=true`: the flagged extension is
static only, its own docstring has the reason, and declining with a
message is what stands in for the dynamic path it does not have.

Running this file directly performs the same work with the current
directory as the build directory, which is useful for an in-place build
outside a wheel:

```shell
uv run python scripts/cffi_build.py
```

### Environment variables

The mode is chosen by the environment, so that CI can build every
artifact from one source tree:

- `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_DYNAMIC=true` builds the dynamic, cffi ABI mode
  extension against a shared libsecp256k1. The default is static
- `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_CROSS_COMPILE=true` cross-compiles with the
  vendored mingw-w64 toolchain file, x86_64 Windows being the only
  supported target. It implies dynamic: a cross-built static extension
  would need the target interpreter's toolchain
- `CFFI_PLATFORM` overrides the detected platform when the target is not
  the host, and is what the cross-compiled wheel is tagged from; it is
  set to `Windows` alongside the variable above
- `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP=true` builds the second, flagged extension
  over the vendored secp256k1-zkp submodule, static only. No published
  wheel sets it; `test.yml`'s own `zkp` job does

Note that the two build-mode variables are not interchangeable as
predicates: the choice between the MSVC and the Unix static path keys
off the real host, while the shared library suffix and the wheel tag key
off the target. `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP` is orthogonal to both --
whether the second extension is built at all, not which of the three
paths builds it.

## The benchmark is not here

It compared these bindings against `coincurve`, `secp256k1` and btclib's
pure python arithmetic, which made the packages it timed dependencies of
this repository's lock — btclib among them, and btclib is what depends on
this package rather than the other way round. It lives in
[btclib-benchmarks](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-benchmarks) now,
as `scripts/libsecp256k1_wrappers.py`, where its comparands are what the
project is for.
