# no html_static_path, matching btclib's own conf.py and for the same
# reason: neither an overridden stylesheet nor a shipped image exists
# here, and sphinx warns about a declared "_static" directory that has
# never existed

# -- Links out of the included root markdown files ----------------------------

# Some of the toctree's pages are this repository's own root markdown,
# each pulled into a *_link.md shim by a myst {include}. Which ones is
# `ls docs/source/*_link.md`, and that glob is also what INCLUDED reads
# below, so the set is derived in one place and this comment does not
# become a second copy of it the next time a shim is added or dropped.
# What is not shimmed is a root file no page renders, which is a fact
# about this repository rather than a rule.
# Those root files are written for the three places that read them
# unrendered -- the GitHub file view, the PyPI long description, and (for
# this repository) nothing else, there being no website served from it --
# so a bare "SECURITY.md" is the correct spelling there, and myst resolves
# not one of those links once the file is lifted into this tree.
#
# What it emits instead is the reason this needs code rather than a
# warning filter, exactly as btclib's own conf.py explains: a target myst
# cannot resolve becomes an anchor on the page it is already on,
# href="#SECURITY.md", an id nothing has. The transform below answers
# each link from the repository rather than from a table that would have
# to be kept in step with this directory: a path a *_link.md shim
# includes becomes a reference to that page, any other path that exists
# in the tree becomes a link to the file on GitHub, and a path that
# exists nowhere is left to myst -- which reports it, and -W then fails.
