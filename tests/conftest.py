"""The threshold a run is held to, which is not the same for every run.

`--cov` is in `addopts`, so the ratchet in `[tool.coverage.report]` is
what a bare `uv run pytest` measures rather than something the coverage
job of `test.yml` alone reaches. What that costs is this file:
`fail_under` applies to every report coverage writes, a partial one
included, so `pytest tests/keys_test.py` would end in `Required test
coverage of 100.0% not reached` -- true of that run and saying nothing
about the tree. A gate whose red cannot be read is what teaches whoever
runs it to reach for `--no-cov`, so a run that asked for less than the
suite is gated at zero instead, and its report still prints.

The second thing here is a guard on that threshold reaching the run at
all. coverage looks for its configuration in the directory the process
started in, so a run started from `tests/` finds no `fail_under`, no
`source` and no `branch = true`. Section 8 of the organization standard
leaves a tree to point such a run at its configuration or to make it say
it is ungated, and this file is the second of the two: such a run is
refused (btclib-org/.github#443).

    No path at all narrows nothing. A path at or above every `testpaths`

    equality: `pytest tests` is what a bare run already collects, and a
    hook reading any path as a subset switches the floor off for the run
    that is the suite (btclib-org/.github#430). `./tests` and `tests/`
    are that same directory under another name, and `.` is above it.

    The two sides are relative to different directories -- a path on the
    command line to where pytest was run from, a `testpaths` entry to
    the rootdir, which is what `testpaths` means -- and both are
    resolved: pytest builds `rootpath` with `os.path.abspath`, which
    leaves a symlink alone where `Path.resolve` follows one, so a tree
