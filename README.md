# Python bindings to libsecp256k1

<!-- The badges are what the reader decides with, in three groups: what the
software is and whether it can be used, whether it works, and what the
OpenSSF makes of it.

Inside the second group the gates come first, in the order a commit meets
them, and the sentinels follow in the order section 10 of the organization
standard schedules them -- the badge order *is* the calendar order over
that subset, which is why the two move together or not at all. The day and
hour each sentinel owns live in that section and are not copied here: a
reader wanting the schedule reads it there, where it is still true.

One badge per line keeps a change to one line and every line inside MD013,
whose 80 columns bind only where a space follows them.

A badge that reports no state -- "we use ruff", "we use uv" -- reports a
choice instead, and those are in CONTRIBUTING.md, beside the prose that
says how the choice is enforced.

To install (and/or upgrade):

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade btclib-secp256k1
```

## Quickstart

Sign and verify, ECDSA and BIP340. Every line below is executed by the
test suite, on every interpreter and every kind of wheel, so an example
that stops working fails a build rather than sitting here:

```python
>>> import hashlib
>>> from btclib_secp256k1 import dsa, keys, ssa, xonly

>>> # BIP340 test vector 1; yours comes from os.urandom or a wallet
>>> prvkey = 0xB7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C762E7160F38B4DA56A784D9045190CFEF
>>> pubkey = keys.pubkey_from_prvkey(prvkey)
>>> msg = hashlib.sha256(b"hello").digest()

```

ECDSA, over the 32-byte hash, with the deterministic RFC6979 nonce:

```python
>>> signature = dsa.sign(msg, prvkey)
>>> dsa.verify(msg, pubkey, signature)
True

```

BIP340 Schnorr, over the same hash, against the x-only key:

```python
>>> xonly_pubkey, parity = xonly.from_pubkey(pubkey)
>>> signature = ssa.sign(msg, prvkey)
>>> ssa.verify(msg, xonly_pubkey, signature)
True

```

Both take the private key as `bytes` or as an `int`, and both return
`bytes`. What each argument may be, and what is refused rather than
coerced, is *What the boundary checks* below; every function states its
own contract in its docstring.

## Versioning

<!-- The link below is read by three checks -- check_submodule_pin.py,
release.yml and vendored-vectors.yml -- each taking the first match of
the same expression in this file rather than this heading by name
(btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#429; check_submodule_pin.py's module
docstring has the full reasoning). That makes this the only place in
README.md that may link to a secp256k1 release tag: a second such link
placed anywhere earlier in the file would silently become the one all
three read instead, with nothing going red. -->

btclib-secp256k1 version numbers track the wrapped libsecp256k1 version:
release M.N.P wraps libsecp256k1 vM.N.P, and the vendored library is
[v0.8.0](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/releases/tag/v0.8.0).
When a new release of the bindings is needed while still wrapping the
same libsecp256k1 version, a fourth number is appended:
0.8.0.1, 0.8.0.2, etc.

<!-- The link below is read by check_submodule_pin.py's zkp half, the
same way the one above is read by its release half -- see that module's
docstring. A commit rather than a tag, because secp256k1-zkp cuts none;
keep this the only link to a secp256k1-zkp commit in this file, for the
same reason the paragraph above gives for its own link. -->

secp256k1-zkp (btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#603) is vendored beside
secp256k1, not in place of it, and carries no release of its own to
track: it is pinned at
[10366dbb](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/commit/10366dbbbfeb11457f2aae3b23e154ab7d6a1fe4),
the tip of its `master` when #603 decided to vendor it. The published
wheels do not build against it; #605 is what reads this submodule at
all. A re-pin is a pull request of its own, reviewing the delta against
the commit named here.

## The name

This package was `btclib_libsecp256k1` up to and including 0.7.1.3, and
0.8.0 is the first release under this name. `lib` named the C library
being wrapped, and a python distribution is not that library: it is
btclib's bindings to secp256k1, which is what the name now says.

Nothing on PyPI bridges the two, deliberately: `btclib_libsecp256k1`
stops at 0.7.1.3 and stays installable, wrapping libsecp256k1 0.7.1, and
`pip install btclib_libsecp256k1` keeps resolving to it rather than
following the rename. Moving means changing the requirement and the
import, which spell the new name differently: the requirement takes the
distribution's hyphen and the import the package's underscore.

```diff
-btclib_libsecp256k1>=0.7.1.3
+btclib-secp256k1>=0.8.0
```

```diff
-from btclib_libsecp256k1 import dsa, keys, ssa, xonly
+from btclib_secp256k1 import dsa, keys, ssa, xonly
```

The two can be installed side by side while that happens: the import
package was renamed with the distribution, so neither shadows the other.
Everything inside the API — the module names, every function, and the
`ffi` and `lib` a caller reaches MuSig2 through — is unchanged.

## Design

These bindings are a boundary, not a library: every function is one
libsecp256k1 call, with its arguments validated first and its return
code checked. A function returning a key or a signature calls it twice:
libsecp256k1 hands back an opaque object — a `secp256k1_pubkey`, a
`secp256k1_ecdsa_signature` — that only a second call serializes into
bytes, no libsecp256k1 call producing them directly.
`keys.pubkey_from_prvkey` is `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` followed by
`secp256k1_ec_pubkey_serialize`; every other function returning a key or
a signature has the same shape, the second call being the serialization
the first cannot do rather than a second decision.

A function that does make a second decision is named after both of them
and is here for one reason: what the composition saves is the crossing
between its halves, which is the caller's cost and not its own choice.
`xonly.from_prvkey` is the private key's public key and then the x of
it; `keys.pubkey_tweak_mul_sum` is a `pubkey_tweak_mul` per term and one
`pubkey_sum` over them, which is the multi-scalar multiplication a
verification equation is written as, with no product serialized on its
way into the sum. Neither computes anything libsecp256k1 does not: the
arithmetic is upstream's calls in the order the equation names them, and
*Parsing the key once* below is where the crossing they save is
measured. One entry point is more than a composition, and it is
`dsa.sign(grind=True)`: a loop that signs again, with a counter mixed
into the nonce, until `r` is the low one. That is Bitcoin Core's
`CKey::Sign` and not a scheme of this package's — a signer's size policy,
which is why it is asked for and never done by default — and *Grinding
for a low r* below is where its cost, and the reason the loop is python
rather than C, are measured. The cryptography —
the algorithms, the constant-time
implementation, the side-channel hardening — is upstream's, and none of
it is reimplemented, extended or second-guessed here. Wrappers of the
same C library cannot honestly differ in what it computes, nor in how
fast; where they can differ is the boundary, and that is where the work
went:

- what runs is known: the version number names the libsecp256k1 being
  wrapped (see Versioning), pinned as a submodule and compiled from
  source with every optional module requested explicitly, upstream
  defaults not being part of its API. `__version__` describes the C
  code underneath, not the wrapper around it
- the surface is complete: every optional module is compiled in and
  reachable, through a validated binding where a function suffices and
  through the raw `lib` where only an object would do (see Wrapped
  modules). What is absent — the ECDH hash callback, linking a system
  library — is absent by recorded decision, not by omission
- no input can take the process down: the bindings validate before
  calling, so a malformed key or signature raises `ValueError` naming
  the check that failed, before the C call could meet it; and the
  vendored build replaces the abort()ing libsecp256k1 default
  callbacks, so even an illegal argument handed to `lib` directly is
  survived, `context.check()` reporting it verbatim. What that
  validation is, and what it deliberately is not, is What the boundary
  checks below
- side channels are the context's problem, and it is handled: the one
  shared context is randomized at import time, before any thread
  exists; concurrent use is documented and tested, free-threaded
  interpreter included (see Thread safety)
- the boundary is typed: `py.typed` ships, mypy runs in strict mode,
  and the cffi extension itself is described by a hand-written stub, so
  what downstream type-checks against is the real signatures rather
  than `Any`
- validation is independent: the tests are published vectors (BIP340,
  RFC6979, third-party fixtures) and invariants over derived inputs,
  never the downstream library these bindings exist to serve; branch
  coverage is ratcheted at 100%, with only the unreachable excluded
  from the measure
- provenance is checkable: every wheel and the sdist are built and
  tested in public CI from the pinned source, and published by the
  workflow itself through Trusted Publishing with PEP 740 attestations
  — no long-lived token, and no maintainer laptop in the path. The sdist
  attached to the GitHub release carries a build provenance attestation
  besides, which `gh attestation verify` checks; SECURITY.md has the
  command

Which library answered is read off the import line. Everything outside
`btclib_secp256k1.zkp` is
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1); everything
under it is
[secp256k1-zkp](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp),
the fork of it carrying the confidential-assets and adaptor-signature
work mainline does not. A namespace rather than an argument on each
call, because the libraries overlap by name and not by API: `musig` is
in both, and the fork's is mainline's entry points plus the ones its
adaptor signatures need, so one `musig` would name both and an import
line could not say which was reached — outside `zkp` it is mainline's
that answers.

The default of the flag that builds the fork flips — the published
wheels then carrying secp256k1-zkp — at the first of the events
btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#603 names, and not before:
"`BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp` cuts a tag, which gives the pin a
release to anchor the vendored-source review against", or "btclib
acquires a run-time caller of anything under `zkp`". Versioning above
names the commit the fork is pinned at, and Build below the flag.

## What the boundary checks

Every wrapper validates its arguments before calling, and what it
validates is deliberately narrow: the boundary checks what C cannot see,
and decides nothing else.

- **sizes are checked here, because nothing else can.** libsecp256k1
  takes bare pointers whose length is in the parameter name — `msg32`,
  `input32`, `seckey` — and reads a fixed number of bytes from them. Hand
  a 32-byte parameter 20 bytes and it reads past the end, and no return
  code or callback of the library can report it: the length never reached
  C to be checked. This is memory safety rather than cryptography, and it
  is the one part that cannot be left to the caller — a binding that
  reads adjacent heap into a signature when handed a short `bytes` would
  be safe only for the single caller who remembers to check first
- **and the type is checked with the size, that check being one
  question.** `len` answers for a `bytearray` and a `memoryview` as
  readily as for `bytes`, so a size check on its own let both through,
  and cffi refused them one call later in its own words and about a
  ctype — naming neither the argument nor what was wrong with it. What
  crosses is octets: `bytes`, `bytearray` or `memoryview`, plus an `int`
  where a scalar is named. Anything else is refused here and called by
  the name the signature gives it — the `TypeError` these wrappers
  raise, every other refusal below being a `ValueError`.
  The three are not a leniency of the kind refused above: each states a
  value *and* a width, so nothing has to be disbelieved and nothing
  supplied — the `int` is the wider door of the two, the 32-octet width
  being the curve's. What they are not is passed through. The copy is
  taken at the boundary, so a caller holding a secret in memory they can
  overwrite — which is the reason to reach for a `bytearray` at all —
  cannot change what libsecp256k1 is about to read
- **validity is libsecp256k1's to decide, and it does.** Whether 32 bytes
  are a scalar in `[1, n-1]` is answered by
  `secp256k1_ec_seckey_verify`, and `keys.prvkey_verify` is that call, not
  a reimplementation of it. A public key becomes one by passing
  `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_parse`, a signature by
  `secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_parse_der`, a tweak by the return value of
  the function applying it; the `ValueError` names what the library
  refused. No wrapper here knows the curve order
- **and a caller validating its own input gets a verdict, not an
  exception.** `keys.prvkey_verify`, `keys.pubkey_verify`,
  `xonly.pubkey_verify` and `dsa.signature_verify` are the four: the same
  proof the `parse` beside each of them makes, with nothing kept and
  nothing to catch. A library holding octets at its own boundary has its
  own word for what is wrong with them, and an exception carrying this
  package's word for it is a message it would have to translate. The
  length is part of the verdict — 34 octets are no public key, and
  answering `False` is what a caller asking "do I have one" wants — where
  every entry point that goes on to *use* the key raises instead
- **nothing is normalized into validity.** An argument of the wrong size
  raises, and is never padded: the 32 bytes of nonce entropy are 32 bytes
  or omitted, a shorter value being a caller mistake rather than a small
  number. They are `aux_rand32` in every module that takes them, BIP340's
  own name for the pair libsecp256k1 spells `ndata` here and `rnd32`
  there, and what omitting them means is the one thing that differs:
  fresh randomness where BIP340 and BIP324 ask for it, and the RFC6979
  nonce alone where ECDSA leaves it deterministic. Taking a public key in any
  of its three serializations is not a leniency of that kind and is worth
  the distinction: BIP340 verification (`ssa.verify`) and taproot
  tweaking (`xonly.tweak_add`, `xonly.tweak_add_check`) take 32, 33 or 65
  octets because `02 || x`, `03 || x` and `04 || x || y` are one key —
  `lift_x` is the even-y point whatever form the x arrived in, and a
  signer whose point has odd y signs with `n - d` for that reason. The y
  is not consulted rather than guessed at, and `xonly.from_pubkey`
  answers which form was handed in for a caller that wants to know. A
  leniency is a guess at what the caller meant, and that decision is
  theirs to make.
  `dsa.verify(..., normalize=True)` is that decision made, rather than an
  exception to it: ECDSA signatures are malleable, which of the two forms
  one carries was the signer's choice, and a caller checking signatures
  it did not make says so in the call instead of round-tripping the
  signature through `dsa.normalize` and back into DER. Off, which is the
  default, a signature outside the lower-s form is refused as before
- **the one convenience is the int scalar,** and it widens nothing. A
  private key or a tweak may be given as an `int`, checked against
  `0 <= num < 2**256` and serialized big endian. This is not the padding
  refused above: a short `bytes` states a value and a width, and accepting
  it means choosing which of the two to disbelieve, while an `int` states
  only a value — the 32-byte width is the curve's, not a fact the caller
  supplied and got wrong. The set of valid scalars is unchanged; only the
  type spelling them is. What the door is for is the caller who already
  holds a number: a nonce, a vector, a tweak just computed.
  The cost is not in that serialization, which is a loop over nine CPython
  digits and measures as noise. It is that an `int` holding a secret was
  produced by python arithmetic, variable in time with the magnitude of
  its operands and leaving unzeroized copies of every intermediate on the
  heap — and that happened before this binding saw the value. `bytes` is
  not zeroized either, so what passing them buys is narrow but real: no
  arithmetic on the secret happened here. Scalar arithmetic that must not
  leak belongs where that can be promised

None of these checks branches on the content of a secret — they look at a
type, a length, or a magnitude, all of which the caller knows already —
so the constant-time guarantee is the C call's, and it is intact. What
python cannot give back is what happens on either side of that call:
`bytes` is not zeroized either, and
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
records both limits as inherent.

And there is a way past all of it: `lib` and `ffi` are exported, and a
call made through them has no python in front of it whatsoever. It is
the path for a caller who wants the library and nothing added to it --
`musig` included, nothing stopping a caller from driving a MuSig2 session
through `lib` directly the way `musig.py` itself does underneath.

## Parsing the key once

A public key crosses this boundary as octets, and every wrapper taking
one begins by parsing it — for a compressed key that is a field square
root, which is a measurable part of the verification that follows it. A
caller that has already paid for that parse can hand it on instead of
paying again: `keys.parse` returns the libsecp256k1 object, and every
wrapper whose first act is to build one has a half that takes it in
place of the octets.

That half is spelled `_foo_`, and both underscores are load-bearing. The
leading one says private, and means it: an object is a promise no
argument check can hold a caller to, so what answers for a wrong one is
libsecp256k1's own illegal-argument callback, and a caller reaching for
these is past the boundary that proves things. The trailing one says
which kind of private — `_verify_` takes a parsed key where `_parse_der`
is an ordinary helper.

**A private half does not read that callback**, and what it answers when
libsecp256k1 refuses its object is therefore whatever the C call
answered: its own exception where a return code allowed one, and
otherwise a value that means nothing — `False` from a verification, an
ordering from a comparison, `None` from a sum, and, in `ecdh`, 32 bytes
that are a shared secret with nobody. Nothing raises in those four.
`context.check()` immediately after the call is what says so, and
proving the object once — `keys.parse` built it, or `keys.pubkey_verify`
answered for the octets it came from — is what makes the question moot.
The public half has no such case, having parsed its own octets, and that
is the whole of what a caller gives up by reaching past it.

```python
>>> ecdsa_sig = dsa.sign(msg, prvkey)
>>> parsed = keys.parse(pubkey)           # a valid point: proved once
>>> parsed_sig = dsa.parse_der(ecdsa_sig)
>>> dsa._verify_(msg, parsed, parsed_sig)  # used, rather than proved again
True

```

The public half is the private one with a `parse` in front of it, and
nothing else about the two differs: the remaining arguments are checked
exactly as before, a bare pointer's length being what no C return code
can report. The callers this is for are the one that validates a key and
then verifies with it, the one checking several signatures against a
single key, and the one asking `is_low_s` about a signature it is about
to verify. `xonly.parse` is the same thing for the x coordinate BIP340
verifies against, `dsa.parse_der` and `dsa.parse_compact` for the two
serializations of a signature, and every one of them has a `serialize`
beside it turning the object back into octets.

The other side of the boundary is spelled the same way. A wrapper that
*produces* an object — recovering a key from a signature, decoding it,
deriving it, adding keys together, signing — serializes what
libsecp256k1 handed it already made, and its private half answers with
the object instead:

```python
>>> from btclib_secp256k1 import recovery
>>> sig, recid = recovery.sign(msg, prvkey)
>>> parsed_recoverable = recovery.parse_compact(sig, recid)
>>> recovered = recovery._recover_(msg, parsed_recoverable)  # the point
>>> dsa._verify_(msg, recovered, parsed_sig)                 # as it stands
True

```

So `_foo_` means one thing in both directions: the half that speaks in
libsecp256k1 objects, where the public half speaks in octets. What it
buys is what composing two wrappers otherwise pays between them — a
serialization of a point that was already in hand, and a parse of what
was just serialized, which for the compressed form is that square root
again. Sorting keys and then adding them together is the composition
that pays it per key; scanning block after block for a silent payment
pays it per transaction, which is why `silentpayments` has a private
half for each of its three entry points, the summary of a transaction's
inputs included.

Some compositions are an entry point instead of two halves, where what
the caller wanted was the composition. `xonly.from_prvkey` is the
x-only public key of a private key — the two halves above composed,
which is what BIP340 and BIP341 ask for and what this package used to
make every caller spell in two steps, with a full public key in the
middle that nothing wanted. `keys.pubkey_tweak_mul_sum` is the other:
a term per scalar and one sum over them, which is a verification
equation, a MuSig2 aggregate key and BIP352's tweak data, and where the
crossing is per term — every product serialized as 65 octets only for
the sum to parse them again. Handed over whole it is about a seventh of
the call from three terms up and stays there, 64 terms 459.3 µs against
536.5; the CHANGELOG entry that added it has the count-by-count table
and the conditions. It is the naive form and not a batched algorithm:
`secp256k1_ecmult_multi_var` is internal to libsecp256k1 and not
declared in its public header, so what is saved here is the crossing,
which is flat in the number of terms.

`ssa.Signer.pubkey` reads that same key off the keypair the signer
already holds, which is a read rather than a multiplication, and so is
cheaper than any composition could be.

## Outposts past the boundary

The private halves above hand one object from a call to the next. What
they do not answer is the caller who crosses the boundary again and
again with the *same* key: a signer signing message after message, a
wallet walking a BIP32 path one index at a time. Each crossing pays the
conversion at its far end — a keypair is a point multiplication, a
compressed key is a field square root — and pays it for a key it had
already converted.

`ssa.Signer` and `keys.PubkeyTweakChain` are the two outposts on that
side of the boundary held for that reason. Each holds the converted
object across calls, so the conversion happens once and every crossing
afterwards carries only what changes: a message, a tweak. `musig`'s
`KeyAggCache`, `Session` and `SecretNonce` hold state too, and for a
different reason the rule below makes precise.

The two are not worth the same, and the numbers below say which is
which. A keypair is *arithmetic* — a point multiplication, half of what
a signature costs — and no serialization would give it back. A parsed
public key is a *parse*, and the caller can make that parse cheap by
carrying the uncompressed form instead: 0.269 microseconds against
2.326. So the signer saves what nothing else can, and the chain saves
what a caller free to choose its serialization could have saved itself.

**The rule that separates them is the test a proposal for a third one
would have to pass**, and it is worth stating on its own, because the
answer to every proposal of that kind — a held public key for
verifying, for ECDH, for combining — is here rather than in the
proposal:

> what an object saves is the cost of *rebuilding, from octets, whatever
> it holds*. It earns its state when that cost is arithmetic, and does
> not when it is a parse.

`musig`'s three do not answer to this rule, and are not measured against
it below: there is no octets form of a keyagg cache, a session or a
secret nonce to rebuild from in the first place, `musig.py`'s own module
docstring saying why. What decides *that* exception is #87's own test —
"a handle is a lifetime someone has to own and invalidate" — which
`ssa.Signer` and `keys.PubkeyTweakChain` never had to pass, holding an
object this package could equally have handed back as bytes.

The saving is not merely bounded by that cost; it *is* that cost, and by
construction rather than by measurement. `ssa.sign` builds the keypair,
signs with it and wipes it; `signer.sign` is that middle term with the
first already paid — so the difference between them is
`secp256k1_keypair_create` on any machine, and what the numbers below
add is that nothing else of consequence sits in it. They are the ones
this section already states: 15.82 microseconds against the signer's
8.27, of which the keypair is 7.55, and 15.82 − 8.27 is that 7.55.

The chain reads the same way and answers differently, which is the
distinction of the paragraph above arrived at from the other end. What
it saves is the parse it holds, so *which* parse decides the figure —
and that is the pair the paragraph above states, the caller's to choose
by the serialization they carry. A keypair offers its caller no such
choice.

Two things the rule needs said, or it reads as narrower than it is. The
first is what recovers a parse, and it is **`keys.parse` itself, not a
cheaper serialization**. The argument through the uncompressed form does
not reach an x-only key, which is a field square root to rebuild and has
no second serialization to escape to — and it does not always reach a
full one either, which is what the walk below measures: from the 33
octets an xpub carries, reaching the uncompressed form costs a
`reserialize` that the chain does not pay. A caller who wants the parse
held holds it — `keys.parse` hands back the object and the private
halves take it, which is what "the private halves above hand one object
from a call to the next" already promised. What a class would add there
is a name, not a saving. The second is the other side of the ledger:
this package is [stateless by construction](#design), and
`musig.KeyAggCache` and `musig.Session` are its exception, each an
object with an owner and an invalidation and, [Thread safety](#thread-safety)
says, its own answer to sharing one across threads. What the rule above
does not weigh is ergonomics — the line a caller does not have to write
is real, and belongs with the caller along with the lifetimes.

So the numbers **confirm** the rule rather than establish it, and it is
worth being clear which of them would survive a different machine. Not
the microsecond counts, which are one laptop's; the identity is what
carries, and it carries because it is structural rather than because a
ratio travels better than an absolute. A rule resting instead on which
of two measurements is larger would invert on the first machine that
measured them differently — and one such pair is a rounding error apart,
which the walk below is about.

`ssa.Signer` holds the keypair:

```python
>>> messages = [hashlib.sha256(bytes([index])).digest() for index in range(3)]
>>> with ssa.Signer(prvkey) as signer:
...     signatures = [signer.sign(each) for each in messages]
>>> [ssa.verify(m, xonly_pubkey, s) for m, s in zip(messages, signatures)]
[True, True, True]

```

`ssa.sign` builds that keypair, signs with it and overwrites it before
returning, so a caller signing a second message under the same key builds
it again — and it is about half of what a BIP340 signature costs here,
15.82 microseconds against the signer's 8.27, of which the keypair is
7.55. `signer.pubkey()` reads the x-only key off it rather than deriving
it a second time.

`keys.PubkeyTweakChain` holds the parsed point:

```python
>>> tweaks = [hashlib.sha256(bytes([index])).digest() for index in range(5)]
>>> chain = keys.PubkeyTweakChain(pubkey)
>>> path = [chain.tweak_add(tweak) for tweak in tweaks]
>>> path[-1] == chain.pubkey()
True

```

That is a BIP32 path walked one index at a time, and the shape of it is
what costs: each step needs the previous step's *serialized* key to hash
into the next tweak, so `pubkey_tweak_add` on the compressed form parses
at every step the very point the step before had built and serialized —
64.62 microseconds against the chain's 55.14, for the five steps above,
which is the 2.326 of a compressed parse saved four times.

What that comparison leaves out is the caller's other move, and it is
worth stating because it is nearly free: walking the same path in the
*uncompressed* form and compressing each answer in python is 54.75, which
is the chain's 55.14 within the noise. The uncompressed parse is 0.269,
so there is almost nothing left for holding the point to save — the
chain's saving is real against the compressed walk and a rounding error
against that one, where the caller already holds the 65 octets — which
two paragraphs below is the assumption that turns out to decide it. What
it is unambiguously worth is not having to write
`bytes([2 + (sec[64] & 1)]) + sec[1:33]` where BIP32 wants 33 octets to
hash. `chain.pubkey()` is the key it has arrived at, and
`chain._pubkey_()` the point itself for a caller handing it on.

The two moves do not compose into a third saving, which is worth saying
because the shape of them invites it. A chain answers whichever
serialization it is asked for, but it re-parses nothing in either: the
point is what it holds. So `chain.tweak_add(compressed=False)` saves no
parse that `chain.tweak_add()` had been paying, and gives back the line
above to be written at every step — it measures slightly slower, for the
serialization and that line, and it is not the spelling to reach for.

What the three numbers do leave unasked is where the walk *starts*. An
xpub carries the 33 octets, so a caller taking the uncompressed path
reaches its starting form through `keys.reserialize` — a compressed
parse, the 2.326 above, and a serialization — before the first step,
and that is rather more than the 0.39 separating the two walks. Counted
from the key a BIP32 caller actually holds, the chain is *ahead* of the
uncompressed walk rather than a rounding error behind it: the parse it
pays at construction is the one that caller could not have avoided, and
it pays it once where the compressed walk pays it five times. Which
does not make the chain's saving arithmetic — this section's distinction
stands — but it is the parse the caller could not make cheap, which is
the case the class is for.

What the two do not share is what they hold. A parsed public key is a
public value a caller may keep for as long as it likes; a keypair is the
private key in libsecp256k1's own layout, so the signer hands the caller
a lifetime and not only a saving. That is what the `with` block is for:
on the way out of it the keypair is overwritten, whether the block ended
in a signature or in an exception, and a wiped signer refuses to sign
rather than signing with the zeros left behind. `signer.wipe()` is the
same instruction spelled by hand, for a caller who is done before the
block is. The chain needs none of it, and has none of it. What none of it
changes is the python side: the `bytes` or `int` the constructor is
handed is a python object like any other, and
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
records why that copy cannot be taken back.

ECDSA has no counterpart, and the reason is in the equation rather than
in the C signature. BIP340 challenges with `e = H(R ‖ P ‖ m)`, so the
*public* key is an input to every signature: it has to be derived, which
is a point multiplication, and the keypair is where it is kept — with
the parity that decides whether the signature is made with `d` or with
`n - d`. ECDSA signs `s = k⁻¹(z + r·d)`, and `P` appears nowhere in it.
There is no object derived from the key, and so nothing to hold across
calls.

What a `dsa.Signer` could save is the argument check `scalar` makes of
the private key: 0.117 microseconds of the 12.93 a signature costs, where
`ssa.Signer` saves the 7.55 of 15.82. What it would cost is the lifetime
the paragraph above describes, a second copy of the secret held for as
long as the signer is. That trade is worth making for half a signature
and not for a hundredth of one.

**The other ground such a signer could be argued on is the memory, and
it needs no signer.** Where a scalar is accepted — a private key, a tweak
— a cffi array of 32 octets is accepted too, and where the call only
*reads* it libsecp256k1 is handed the caller's own memory. So a caller
signing again and again under one key can hold it in
`ffi.new("unsigned char[32]")`, wipe that when done, and have no `bytes`
of the key made per signature. It is the only argument of these bindings
that is not copied on the way in, and the trade is stated where the
copying one is: the copy `bytes` and `bytearray` get is also what stops
the caller changing the octets libsecp256k1 is reading, and a caller who
hands in memory instead of a value has taken that on.
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
carries it with the wipe that goes with it.

Which item type the array was declared as does not matter — `char`,
`unsigned char`, `uint8_t`, `signed char` — because what crosses is a
re-view of those octets rather than a conversion of them. What is refused
is a pointer, whose length is not the pointer's own to know, an array of
wider items, which is this machine's byte order rather than a scalar, and
any length but 32.

**Some calls copy it, and are meant to.** `keys.prvkey_negate`,
`keys.prvkey_tweak_add` and `keys.prvkey_tweak_mul` copy because
libsecp256k1 writes the answer through that pointer.
`zkp.generator.pedersen_blind_generator_blind_sum` copies for that
reason too: secp256k1-zkp writes the correction through the last element
of its `blinding_factor` array, which the header declares In/Out. The
sender side of `silentpayments`, `zkp.generator.pedersen_blind_sum` and
that same call copy because this package wipes what it copied on the way
out. Handing any of them the caller's memory would negate, overwrite or
zero the secret they passed, so a copy is owed. `_secret.scalar_buffer`
takes it where mainline's own `ffi` allocates; the two in
`zkp.generator` take theirs through the subpackage's `ffi`, which is
what every array there is built through. Those of them that *answer* a
new secret take a keyword-only `into`, which is the other facility's
question rather than this one's — it is how that secret comes back into
a buffer instead of a `bytes`. The sender side of `silentpayments` takes
none: what `silentpayments.create_outputs` answers is the x-only public
keys of the outputs, no entry point of that module has an `into` at all,
and the copy it takes is owed for the wiping reason alone.

Where that binds is not the signing, which never asked: the private
halves hand libsecp256k1 the pointer, so a key in a buffer reached
`_signed` before this and reaches it now. It binds on the *derivation* —
`keys._pubkey_from_prvkey_` asks for a scalar — and the sharpest case is
the failing branch of the check above, which derives in order to tell a
wrong argument from a fault: with the key in a buffer it used to answer
`TypeError: the private key must be bytes or an int`, telling a caller
they had mistyped the argument they had passed correctly. Which is the
reason the door is open, rather than the microsecond a signer would have
hoisted.

What does cost in `dsa.sign` is the DER serialization, 0.757
microseconds, and a caller who wanted the other form never has to pay it:
`compact=True` answers the 64 octets of `r ‖ s` directly, where reaching
them through `to_compact` writes the DER and parses it straight back.

## Checking the signature before answering with it

`dsa.sign`, `ssa.sign` and `recovery.sign` check what they just made
against the very key that made it, and a signature that fails is raised
on rather than returned. It is the one argument here that defaults to
on, and `verify=False` is how a caller declines it.

The three have the same reasoning behind them and did not arrive by the
same route. For BIP340 it is a step of the algorithm: *Default Signing*
ends with "If Verify(bytes(P), m, sig) returns failure, abort", and the
note beside it says why — "Verifying the signature before leaving the
signer prevents random or attacker provoked computation errors. This
prevents publishing invalid signatures which may leak information about
the secret key. It is recommended, but can be omitted if the computation
cost is prohibitive." Schnorr is linear, so what leaks is not vague: two
signatures over one nonce and two challenges give up `d` by subtraction.
For ECDSA no standard asks for it and Bitcoin Core does it anyway, at the
end of `CKey::Sign`, under a comment reading "Additional verification
step to prevent using a potentially corrupted signature" — and Core
offers no way to turn it off, where this does.

What it catches is not a bad argument: those have all raised by the time
it runs. It catches the computation itself going wrong, whether by bad
memory or by a fault induced on purpose, and the whole of the protection
is not publishing the result.

`recovery.sign` asks a different question, and the section below says
why. What it shares with the other two is the reason and the argument.

It costs what a verification costs, and in ECDSA a point multiplication
besides — the public key, which BIP340 needs to sign at all and ECDSA
needs for neither of the two things `sign` does. Measured with the
variants alternated in one process, an Apple M5, macOS 26.6, arm64,
CPython 3.13.14, seven rounds of 20 000 calls with the minimum of each
kept, and a last row running one of them a second time so that the noise
has a figure of its own:

| the call | `verify=False` | `verify=True` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dsa.sign` | 12.15 | 31.67 |
| `ssa.sign` | 15.87 | 28.57 |
| `ssa.Signer.sign` | 8.18 | 20.82 |
| `ssa.sign` again (the noise) | | ±0.04 |

and `recovery.sign` in a session of its own, which re-measured `dsa.sign`
beside it so that the two are comparable rather than merely printed
together — 12.06 against 31.54 for `dsa.sign` there, agreeing with the
row above, and a noise row of ±0.02:

| the call | `verify=False` | `verify=True` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recovery.sign` | 12.02 | 34.41 |

Microseconds per signature. The finding is the gap between the two
increments: 19.5 for ECDSA against 12.7 for BIP340, and the 6.8 between
them is the multiplication `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` does and
`secp256k1_keypair_xonly_pub` does not — the keypair holds the point
already, which is the same 7.55 the [signer](#outposts-past-the-boundary)
hoists. So the step the specification prescribes is also the cheaper of
the two, and a `Signer` pays it at the same price as a bare `ssa.sign`.

**`verify=False` is not the only thing a caller can do about that gap.**
`dsa.sign` takes a `pubkey`, the key the check verifies under, so that a
caller already holding it does not have the multiplication done again.
That is most of what ECDSA's check costs above BIP340's, and handing the
key in brings the two to the same operation — a bare verification. In a
session of its own, an Apple M5, macOS 26.6, arm64, CPython 3.13.14, nine
rounds of 3 000 calls with the minimum of each kept, and the unchecked
signature run a second time so the noise has a figure of its own — its
`dsa.sign` rows sitting a few tenths under the two sessions above, which
is between sessions and not within any of them:

| `dsa.sign` | per call | the check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verify=False` | 11.72 | |
| the key derived, as before | 31.92 | 20.20 |
| a compressed key handed in | 26.80 | 15.08 |
| an uncompressed key handed in | 24.78 | 13.06 |
| the point already parsed, through `_sign_` | 24.52 | 12.80 |
| `verify=False` again (the noise) | 11.76 | ±0.04 |

The 7.40 between the second row and the last is the derivation, which is
`secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` through `keys._pubkey_from_prvkey_`. Timed
alone in a session of the same shape it is 7.31, against a noise of
±0.14. The 7.55 above is a different call — the keypair's own
multiplication — and lands within half a microsecond of it because the
two do the same work.

Within the rows where the key is handed in, 2.02 is what a *compressed*
key costs to parse over an uncompressed one — the field square root that
recovers y, which is why the longer encoding is the cheaper argument
here — and 0.26 is the uncompressed parse itself, which only the private
half avoids. Those are what the parse adds back above the fully parsed
row, not slices of the derivation above.

The key is taken on trust: checking it against the private key would
cost the multiplication the argument exists to save. What that would
otherwise confuse is a wrong argument with a wrong computation, since a
key that is not this private key's fails verification exactly as a fault
does, so the failing branch — and only that one — derives the key and
asks again: `RuntimeError` where the signature does not verify under the
key the private key actually has, `ValueError` where it does. A key
handed in beside `verify=False` is refused rather than ignored.

What the trust cannot do is pass a bad signature. The keys a signature
verifies under are a property of that signature, so a key fixed before
the signature exists is not one of them, and the argument can cost a
wrong diagnosis but never a wrong success. It can also catch what the
derived check cannot: a private key corrupted before it was signed with
agrees with a public key derived from the same corrupted octets, and
does not agree with one that came from anywhere else.

`ssa.sign` takes no such argument, and that is a decision rather than an
omission: its check is a bare verification already, the keypair holding
the point, so there would be nothing to save and one more way for a
check to fail. `recovery.sign` takes it: its check derived the very same
key before comparing what it recovered against it, and that check is the
dearest of the three. The saving is not larger for that, being the same
call at the same price, and the table below is where both are read. What
taking it cost is a third cause a mismatch can have, which is the
recovery id.

**`recovery.sign` recovers instead of verifying**, and the difference is
the recovery id. A verification does not look at it: a recoverable
signature carrying the wrong one verifies perfectly and then recovers a
key that is not the signer's — and recovering a key is the one thing a
caller of that module is going to do with the answer. So the check is
the one the id deserves: recover from the signature, and refuse a key
that is not the one that signed.

That is Bitcoin Core's own distinction, and it makes it in the same
file. `CKey::Sign` ends in `secp256k1_ecdsa_verify`; `CKey::SignCompact`
ends in `secp256k1_ecdsa_recover` followed by `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_cmp`
against the key derived from the private one. Both under the same
comment.

It subsumes the verification exactly, rather than probably. Recovery is
not selective: for a given id it answers *the* key under which that `r`
and `s` verify, so an inconsistent pair does not fail — it comes back as
a different key, and fails only where `r` is not the x of a point at
all. That is the stronger argument rather than a weaker one. Because the
recovered key is by construction the key that verifies the signature,
`recovered == signer` **is** a verification, with the id checked besides;
nothing is given up by no longer verifying, and it is provable rather
than argued. What it costs is 22.4 microseconds against ECDSA's 19.5 — a
recovery being about a verification's work, and the comparison and the
derivation making up the rest.

What the three check is not quite the same region either, and
`recovery`'s is the one worth knowing: what its check reads is the id
held inside the `secp256k1_ecdsa_recoverable_signature`, while the id the
caller receives is the one `serialize_compact` writes afterwards — so the
recovery id is outside the checked region exactly as a DER encoding is.
Core does the same, `CKey::SignCompact` recovering from its `rsig` and
not from the octets it filled. `ssa` verifies the very 64 octets it
answers with; `dsa` verifies the signature *object* and serializes it
afterwards, so the DER or compact encoding is outside what was checked —
as it is in Core, whose `CKey::Sign` verifies the
`secp256k1_ecdsa_signature` and serializes after. All three are
defensible, the serializers being memcpy-shaped where the signing is
arithmetic, and the difference is worth a sentence rather than a
change.

**The derivation inside it is what a caller can hand in**, exactly as
`dsa.sign` takes it. Measured in one session with `dsa.sign` beside it so
that the two are comparable rather than merely printed together — an
Apple M5, macOS 26.6, arm64, CPython 3.14.6, nine rounds of 3 000 calls
with the minimum of each kept, and the unchecked signature run a second
time so the noise has a figure of its own:

| `recovery.sign` | per call | the check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verify=False` | 12.07 | |
| the key derived, as before | 35.00 | 22.93 |
| a compressed key handed in | 29.67 | 17.60 |
| an uncompressed key handed in | 27.49 | 15.42 |
| the point already parsed, through `_sign_` | 27.25 | 15.18 |
| `verify=False` again (the noise) | 12.09 | ±0.02 |

`dsa.sign` in that same session was 12.14 unchecked, 31.97 with the key
derived and 24.55 with an uncompressed one handed in — a check of 19.83
becoming 12.41 — which puts both of its tables here within a few tenths
of the ones above, between sessions and not within either. The 7.51 the
argument removes is `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` and nothing else: timed
alone in the same session it is 7.53. The 2.18 between the two
serializations is the field square root that recovers y, and the 0.24
under it is the uncompressed parse only the private half avoids. What
stays is what a recovery and a comparison cost over a verification, about
3 microseconds either way it is read — 15.42 against 12.41 with a key
handed in, 22.93 against 19.83 with it derived — and that it is the same
3 both times is what says the argument took the derivation away and left
the rest alone.

The diagnosis costs one comparison more than `dsa`'s, and pays it only
where something is already wrong. A mismatch here has three causes where
`dsa`'s has two — the key given, the recovery id, or the computation —
and the derivation the matching path skipped is what separates the one
that is an argument from the two that are not. Where the recovered key
is the signer's after all, the key handed in is the wrong one, which is a
`ValueError`; where it is not, the signature does not recover its own
signer, which is what a wrong id and a fault both look like from here.
Neither of those is anything a caller of `sign` passed — the id comes
back from `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable` beside the signature, so a
wrong one is a fault by the time the check runs — and that is why the two
share the `RuntimeError`.

Every other microsecond figure in this file was measured before this
argument existed and is therefore the signature without the check:
`verify=False` is the column they are in.

## Grinding for a low r

`dsa.sign(grind=True)` answers the signature of the same key and message
whose `r` has its high bit clear. DER spends a leading zero octet on an
integer whose top bit is set, so that signature encodes one octet
shorter — which is what Bitcoin Core's `CKey::Sign` grinds for, and this
is Core's scheme rather than a rephrasing of it: the first attempt is the
plain RFC6979 signature, and each retry mixes a `uint32` counter, little
endian in the first 4 of 32 octets, into the nonce. Written any other
way it would answer octets nobody else answers; written this way,
`tests/vectors_test.py` holds it to Core's own vectors and to
rust-secp256k1's.

It costs a signature and then some: 24.9 microseconds against the 11.7 of
a plain one, measured beside it over 2000 keys, because half the attempts
are wasted and the tail is longer than the average — 2.09 attempts on the
mean, and the worst of those 2000 keys took 14. That is why it is a
parameter and not the default, and why `s` is not mentioned in the same
breath: libsecp256k1 has already returned the lower of the two, so there
is nothing there to grind for.

Where the loop is written was measured, not assumed. Four loops answering
the same signature, alternated in one process — 2000 keys signed once
each, seven rounds, the minimum of each kept — with the compact form of
the result, which is what the retry reads, and a last row running the
implemented loop a second time so that the noise has a figure of its own:

| the loop | microseconds per signature |
| --- | --- |
| a caller's own, over the public wrappers, once per attempt | 24.7 |
| as implemented, asking `is_low_r` per attempt | 24.8 |
| the same, keeping one compact buffer per call | 24.6 |
| the same again, with both scratch buffers at module level | 24.5 |
| the implemented loop, run twice (the noise) | ±0.1 |

The finding is the spread: three tenths of a microsecond separate the
four, against a noise row of one, and the caller's own loop is not
measurably behind the one inside the package. So what crossing this
boundary once per signature could save is somewhere inside that spread —
and most of what is in it is the per-attempt serialization the predicate
costs, not where the buffers live, the two buffer rows being 0.1 apart. A
loop compiled in C would have started from the last row, and it would
have cost the one thing these bindings do not trade: a
[dynamic build](#the-vendored-library-is-not-optional) compiles no C at
all, so a C helper would be a feature the static wheels have and the
dynamic ones do not. Which leaves grinding here worth having for the
scheme and the vectors that judge it, and not for the microseconds.

Holding the buffers at module level is what the last row costs, and it is
not available anyway: a package with one shared context and a
[thread safety](#thread-safety) story does not get to keep scratch memory
where a second thread reaches it.

What the loop tests is `is_low_r`, which is the compact serialization and
not the DER length: the two are not the same question, DER being
`6 + lenR + lenS`, so a high `r` of 33 octets with an `s` that happens to
need only 31 encodes to 70 octets too — about one signature in 500 — and
a length test would take those for low-r ones. The first octet of the
compact form is the top of `r`, which is exactly what Core's
`SigHasLowR` reads. A caller asks the same question of a signature it did
not make with `dsa.is_low_r`, and it is a question and not a rule: unlike
`is_low_s`, nothing rejects a high-r signature, which is valid and always
was. What it says is that this one is an octet shorter than it might have
been.

The entropy argument is refused together with it. Grinding writes the
very 32 octets `aux_rand32` is, so `dsa.sign(msg, key, aux, grind=True)`
raises rather than resolving silently in favour of one of them.
`recovery.sign` has no `grind`, and the reason is that there is nothing
to shorten: a recoverable signature is 65 fixed octets, so grinding one
would buy the caller two signatures' worth of nothing.

## Wrapped modules

All the optional libsecp256k1 modules are compiled in and their
declarations are available through the `lib` and `ffi` cffi objects. The
table is mainline's:

| libsecp256k1 module | bindings                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| (core)              | `dsa`, `keys`, `hashes`                   |
| `ecdh`              | `ecdh`                                    |
| `recovery`          | `recovery`                                |
| `extrakeys`         | `xonly`, used by `ssa`                    |
| `schnorrsig`        | `ssa`                                     |
| `musig`             | `musig` (BIP327)                          |
| `ellswift`          | `ellswift` (BIP324)                       |
| `silentpayments`    | `silentpayments` (BIP352)                 |

`keys` provides the public key of a private key (`pubkey_from_prvkey`,
compressed by default, `compressed=False` for the uncompressed form)
and the scalar and point algebra (tweaking, negation,
combination, arbitrary point multiplication, and the multi-scalar
multiplication of `pubkey_tweak_mul_sum`) underlying BIP32 key
derivation, plus the lexicographic ordering of public keys (`pubkey_cmp`,
`pubkey_sort`) that BIP67 and MuSig2 key aggregation call for; `xonly`
provides the BIP341 taproot tweaking of x-only public keys and of their
private keys, and the x-only public key itself, from a full public key
(`from_pubkey`) or straight from a private key (`from_prvkey`);
`hashes` provides the BIP340 tagged hash, the domain separation the
taproot tags are built on.

Wherever one of these answers a *secret* — a tweaked or negated private
key, a shared secret, a nonce — it also takes a keyword-only `into`: a
writable buffer of exactly 32 contiguous octets, which receives the
secret in place of the `bytes` the call would otherwise return, so that
the copy the caller is left holding is one they can overwrite. It is an
addition and not a change; omit it and nothing differs. SECURITY.md is
where what it does and does not buy is stated, and names the
`silentpayments` secrets it does not reach.

Two of those have a second spelling for a caller doing arithmetic rather
than holding a key. `keys.pubkey_sum` is `pubkey_combine` with the point
at infinity answered as `None` instead of refused: `P + (-P)` is the
identity, which a curve library has a value for and which no
`secp256k1_pubkey` can hold, so the sum that is no public key is the one
thing the two calls do differently. And `xonly.to_pubkey` is the lift:
an x-only key is an x, the point it names is the one with even y, and
reading that y is `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_parse` of `0x02 || x` — octets a
caller used to write itself, there being no libsecp256k1 call from an
x-only object back to a point.

Converting between two serializations of the same value is
`keys.reserialize` for a key and `dsa.to_der` and `dsa.to_compact` for a
signature. Two names there and one here, because which serialization a
signature arrived in cannot be read off its octets: a DER signature of 64
of them exists, and begins with the `0x30` a compact `r` may begin with
too. So the input form is named by the call, as `compact` names it on
`dsa.sign` and `dsa.verify`, where a key's is read from its length.

`ssa.sign` signs a 32-byte message hash, as bitcoin does; `ssa.sign_custom`
signs a message of any length, which BIP340 allows and which a protocol
of its own may define.

`dsa.nonce_rfc6979` and `ssa.nonce_bip340` answer the nonce each signer
derives, which is the one part of signing these bindings used to compute
and never show. libsecp256k1 exports both derivations as callable
pointers, so this is the C function itself rather than a second
implementation of it, called with what the signer passes it -- and what
comes back is the `k` of the signature the same arguments produce, which
is how `tests/nonces_test.py` checks it: `r` is the x of `k` times the
generator. A python implementation of either derivation has published
vectors and, until now, no oracle. The nonce is the secret a signature is
built on, so reading one into python takes it out of constant-time code:
what these are for is checking a derivation, not driving one.

`ecdh.shared_secret` returns the SHA256 of the compressed shared point,
the libsecp256k1 default. The hash function is not exposed: libsecp256k1
takes it as a C callback, and a protocol needing another derivation has
the shared point itself as `keys.pubkey_tweak_mul(pubkey, prvkey)`,
constant time like the ECDH call and without python in the middle of it.

`silentpayments` is BIP352, and the elliptic curve half of it, which is
what libsecp256k1 implements: `create_outputs` is the sender's side and
takes the private keys of the inputs the payment is funded from,
`prevouts_summary` and `scan_outputs` the recipient's, and `label` and
`labeled_spend_pubkey` the several addresses one scan key can receive
at. What is not there is what BIP352 states over scripts -- which inputs
of a transaction are eligible, and which of those are taproot -- because
that is a script question and there is no script here: the two kinds of
key are two arguments, and the caller says which is which.
`tests/vectors_test.py` drives both directions of every BIP352 vector,
and reads that eligibility off the keys the vector file itself publishes
rather than off its scripts, for the same reason.

Two things about it are worth knowing before it is used. The summary
`prevouts_summary` returns is opaque and not a serialization: what is
inside is libsecp256k1's own, portable across neither platforms nor
versions, and the only thing to do with it is hand it to `scan_outputs`
in the same process. And the label cache is a mapping the caller owns:
libsecp256k1 recognizes a label by calling back to look it up, so a
labeled output is found only if its label is in the mapping handed in --
which is also why the keys of that mapping are `bytes` and only bytes,
a `bytearray` and a `memoryview` not being hashable.

`secp256k1_context_set_sha256_compression`, new in libsecp256k1 0.8.0,
has no binding, by the decision that keeps the ECDH hash out: it replaces
the SHA256 compression function the library uses internally, and its
purpose is to route it to a hardware implementation. Reached from python
it would do the opposite -- a python call per 64-byte block, in the
innermost loop of every hash the library computes -- so what it is for is
unreachable through these bindings and what it would be is a way to make
them slow. It remains available through `lib` for a caller who has a C
function pointer to give it.

MuSig2 is wrapped, in `musig`. What its two-round protocol needs is a
session whose secret nonce cannot be reused, and that is a property of
an object's lifetime rather than of a function: only whoever owns the
session can invalidate it. This package is otherwise stateless by
construction, every other function being one libsecp256k1 call with its
arguments validated, and `musig.KeyAggCache` and `musig.Session` are its
exception -- the *Outposts past the boundary* section above says why the
existing rule for holding an object does not reach them, and `musig.py`'s
own module docstring records the decision to take the exception rather
than to leave the state to whoever calls this package, `KeyAggCache` and
`Session` having no serialization to hand back regardless.

`musig.SecretNonce` is the object that carries the secret: `nonce_gen`
and `nonce_gen_counter` return one, `partial_sign` wipes it whether it
signs or is refused, and a session abandoned before that -- the case
libsecp256k1 itself cannot see -- is `wipe`, or the `with` statement that
calls it on the way out. `ssa.Signer` is the model this follows, and
SECURITY.md records both as the buffers in this package whose zeroing is
asked for rather than done.

A PSBT's multi-party signing state is not what `musig.Session` is:
that object is scoped to one process and one two-round exchange -- it
has no serialization, the module docstring above giving the reason
that is taken as an exception here -- so whoever needs PSBT-level
coordination holds that state elsewhere, outside this package.

The aggregate signature `Session.partial_sig_agg` answers is a plain
BIP340 signature, over the aggregate key `KeyAggCache.pubkey_get` or
`agg_pubkey` names: `ssa.verify` is what checks it, and nothing in
`musig` duplicates that call. `keys.pubkey_sort` is BIP327's key
ordering, applied before `KeyAggCache` if the signers have not agreed on
another one.

A call made through `lib` directly -- which `musig`'s own functions are,
underneath, and which a caller reaching past them is free to make too --
has no argument validation in front of it, so libsecp256k1 is the only
thing checking its preconditions: it reports a violated one through a
callback of the context and returns 0, leaving nothing in the return
value to say what happened. `context.check()` raises what was reported,
the failed precondition verbatim, and is meant to follow such a call:

```python
if not lib.secp256k1_musig_partial_sign(ctx, psig, secnonce, ...):
    context.check()  # ValueError, naming the failed precondition
```

That example is the one that matters: partial signing zeroes the secret
nonce, so signing twice with it is refused, and this is how a caller
reaching `lib` directly learns why -- `musig.SecretNonce.partial_sign`
answers its own `ValueError` for the same case instead, its callers
having no callback to read. The entry points taking octets need none of
it, validating their arguments before calling; the private halves taking
an object need exactly it, for the reason *Parsing the key once* gives.
Either way the abort()ing libsecp256k1 defaults are replaced by
do-nothing stubs in the vendored build, so no illegal argument can take
the hosting process down.

`btclib_secp256k1.zkp` is the same layout over secp256k1-zkp: a `lib`
and an `ffi` of its own, a `zkp.context` holding that library's own
shared context and raising what it reported, and a wrapper module per
secp256k1-zkp module wrapped. Which those are is
[the API documentation](https://btclib-secp256k1.readthedocs.io) rather
than a list here, that set growing a module at a time.
`silentpayments` runs the other way: secp256k1-zkp has no such module at
the commit Versioning names, so BIP352 is mainline's alone.

## Thread safety

The bindings can be called concurrently from several threads. They hold
a single libsecp256k1 context, created and randomized at import time and
passed to every call: `secp256k1_context_randomize` is what mutates a
context, it runs once before any thread exists, and each call allocates
the buffers it writes to.

This matters on a free-threaded interpreter, for which a wheel is built
(`cp314t`), where those calls are no longer serialized;
`tests/concurrency_test.py` exercises it.

`btclib_secp256k1.zkp.context` holds a second, separate context, one
library over, and does not build it the same way: the guarantee above
rests on the shared context above being built at plain module scope,
which Python's own import lock serializes for every thread that reaches
it; `zkp`'s is deferred to the first call instead, by decision (#607
onward), so that importing the subpackage never reaches for the flagged
extension on its own. `context._lock` is what makes that deferred build
safe under several threads (#717): held for the whole of it, so two
threads racing the first call still build one context between them
rather than one each, freeing the other's callback closures out from
under it.

The outposts above are what hold a buffer across calls, and they answer
differently. `ssa.Signer` does not cost that guarantee: libsecp256k1
takes a keypair const, so several threads may sign through one signer.
What is theirs to order is the wipe, which overwrites the very memory a
concurrent signature is reading — the same shape of race as
re-randomizing the context below, and the reason the `with` block ends
where the threads have joined. `musig.Session` reads the same way: every
call that takes one — `SecretNonce.partial_sign`, `partial_sig_verify`,
`partial_sig_agg` — takes it const, `secp256k1_musig_session` never
being written to after `Session.__init__` builds it, so several threads
may verify or sign through one session at once.

`keys.PubkeyTweakChain` is the exception, and by construction:
`secp256k1_ec_pubkey_tweak_add` takes its key as *in and out*, so every
`tweak_add` writes the point the chain holds. One chain belongs to one
thread, and a path is a sequence in any case — two threads sharing one
are not two walkers of it but two writers of the same point. Each thread
that wants one builds its own, which costs the parse the chain exists to
pay once. `musig.KeyAggCache` is the same shape: `pubkey_ec_tweak_add`
and `pubkey_xonly_tweak_add` write the cache in place, so two threads
tweaking one race, where two threads only ever *reading* it — through
`nonce_gen`, `Session.__init__`, `partial_sign` — do not, none of those
calls writing to it.

`musig.SecretNonce` is neither of the two shapes above, being narrower
than both: it is meant to be read exactly once, from whichever thread
gets there first, and refused everywhere else — a keypair's
read-any-number-of-times constness does not apply, and neither does a
chain's one-object-one-thread convention, since a shared secret nonce
is exactly the case this class has to make safe rather than ask a
caller to avoid. Reading `self._secnonce` and then clearing it are two
statements, and without ordering them two threads calling
`partial_sign` on the same object could each pass the read before
either reaches the clear, and both go on to drive
`secp256k1_musig_partial_sign` over the same native secnonce at once —
an unsynchronized concurrent access on the exact memory a MuSig2
nonce-reuse leak comes from, the worst failure this module has. A lock
private to the instance is what orders it: `SecretNonce._take` makes
the read and the clear one atomic step, so at most one caller — from
any thread — ever receives the object. `tests/concurrency_test.py`
races `WORKERS` threads on one `SecretNonce` and asserts exactly one
signs.

The one way to lose that guarantee is to re-randomize the shared context
while it is in use. `context._randomize(context.ctx)` is there for a
caller who wants fresh blinding, and libsecp256k1 asks for exclusive
access to a context to mutate one: call it before the threads start, or
hold a read-write lock over every call that takes `ctx`.

What `context.check()` reports is per thread: the callback recording it
runs on the thread of the call that triggered it, which is what
attributes a message to the right caller.

What is not protected is the secret material itself, which lives in
Python objects for as long as the interpreter keeps them: see
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## The vendored library is not optional

Linking against a libsecp256k1 already installed on the system, instead
of the vendored one, is what a distribution packager needs: Debian,
Fedora, conda-forge, Nix and Alpine have policies against vendored copies
of a cryptographic library. This package does not offer that mode, by
decision, and the account of it belongs here rather than in a closed
issue.

In favour of it:

- it is the only way to reach the users of apt, dnf and conda, who do not
  install from PyPI at all; the coincurve fork
  [libsecp256k1-py-bindings](https://github.com/MementoRC/libsecp256k1-py-bindings)
  exists to fill exactly that gap for a conda-forge recipe
- a libsecp256k1 vulnerability would then be fixed once for the whole
  system, instead of once per wheel of every package vendoring it
- it would cost little to add: the build is a single CMake path, so there
  is exactly one method to bypass, and pkg-config already knows where an
  installed library and its headers are

Against it:

- the versioning contract above breaks, and nothing can detect that it
  has: libsecp256k1 has no runtime version function, and no version macro
  in its headers either, so `__version__` would go on claiming the
  version it wraps over a library of any vintage. The only
  machine-readable version is the pkg-config field, read at build time
  and gone afterwards
- the module set stops being an assertion: headers are installed per
  module, so what is there can be detected, but a distribution ships an
  older library, without `musig` or `ellswift`, and `recovery` is off by
  default upstream. Every binding module would need a capability check,
  and the table above a column of conditions
- the abort() semantics would differ between the two builds: the shared
  context sets its own callbacks, so the bindings stay safe either way,
  but a system library is built with the abort()ing defaults, so a
  context created through `lib` could take the process down, which is
  what `tests/core_test.py` asserts cannot happen
- the test suite would become conditional on the library it finds, where
  the ratchet is measured on the two linkages this tree builds from the
  vendored source and on nothing whose vintage it does not know
- it is a second build path, which unifying on CMake removed, and a
  support surface: reports about a libsecp256k1 this project did not
  build, possibly patched downstream, in consensus critical code

It stays out until a packager asks for it. The value is in opening a
channel, and the costs above are paid from the first day, whether anyone
walks it or not.

## Build

The vendored libsecp256k1 is built with CMake on every platform, out of
tree: the submodule is only ever read from. CMake is declared as a build
requirement, so a PEP 517 frontend provisions it and only a C toolchain
has to be there already; a system CMake 3.22 or newer serves just as
well, with `--no-build-isolation`.

The cffi extension itself is compiled with the interpreter's own
toolchain, which on Windows is the standard setuptools/MSVC one; a `gcc`
in the PATH is still required there, as it preprocesses the library
headers for cffi. Both Windows architectures are built this way: the
vendored library is built for the architecture of the interpreter, which
is what its toolchain compiles the extension for, and not for the one of
the host, which is what CMake would otherwise pick. The two differ
whenever the interpreter is emulated, and on Windows arm64 that is the
default case rather than an exotic one; the same holds for a universal2
interpreter on macOS, which needs both architectures in the archive it
links. The `win_arm64` wheels start at CPython 3.11, the first version
with a Windows arm64 build.
The dynamic (ABI mode) Windows wheel is instead cross-compiled on Linux
with mingw-w64, through the vendored CMake toolchain file, and is
x86_64 only.

`BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP=true` builds a second static extension, over
the vendored secp256k1-zkp, beside the one every wheel carries: it is
what `btclib_secp256k1.zkp` loads, and no published wheel carries it.
[scripts/README.md](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/blob/main/scripts/README.md)
has that variable beside the ones choosing among the paths above, and
says what `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP=true` alongside one of them does:
the build declines, this extension having no dynamic form.

## Release process

Releases are published to PyPI by the `release` GitHub workflow using
[Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/):
no long-lived PyPI token exists anywhere; PyPI trusts the workflow
itself (via GitHub OIDC) and hands out a short-lived upload token at
run time. Wheels and sdist are uploaded with PEP 740 attestations, so
their provenance can be verified on PyPI; the sdist attached to the
GitHub release is signed a second time, so that copy can be verified
without the index.

The steps to cut a release, to rehearse one on TestPyPI, and the
one-time setup each index needs are in
[RELEASING.md](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/blob/main/RELEASING.md).

## Comparison

Wrappers of the same C library cannot honestly differ in what it
computes, nor in how fast — the point Design makes above about where the
actual work goes, `coincurve`, `secp256k1-py` and `electrum-ecc`
included, every one of them the same libsecp256k1 underneath. That does
not make the difference unmeasurable, only certain about what it is a
difference *in*: not the cryptography, which is upstream's regardless of
which wrapper calls it, but the boundary each one places around the same
calls — how much a caller pays to cross it. Measuring that honestly, and
publishing the run rather than a claim, is what
[btclib-benchmarks](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-benchmarks) is
for, and
[the libsecp256k1 wrappers table](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-benchmarks/blob/main/results/01-libsecp256k1.md)
is where this project's own boundary is timed against the others', one
run kept whole rather than reduced to a single figure — an order of
magnitude to read there, never a number to quote here.
