"""Overwriting the libsecp256k1 buffers a secret passes through.

What SECURITY.md records as inherent is the python side: a `bytes` is
immutable, so the secret a caller hands in and the one handed back stay
in the process until the garbage collector gets to them, and may have
been copied on the way. The buffers here are not that. They are memory
cffi allocated and this package owns, they are writable, and nothing
outside these wrappers ever sees them -- so the copy they hold is the
one copy that can be taken back.

It buys one copy, not safety: the `bytes` returned to the caller holds
the same secret and cannot be overwritten. Scalar work that must not
leave a trace belongs where that can be promised.

`into` is where that last copy stops being a `bytes`. A caller who
hands a producer of secrets a writable buffer gets the secret written
there and nothing returned, so the un-zeroizable object is never made
-- and the wiping of what is left is theirs, which is the whole of the
difference. #87 declined an opaque *handle* for a reason this does not
disturb: a handle is a lifetime someone has to own and invalidate, and
belongs where the signing state lives. This is one argument and one
call, and owns nothing.

The one such buffer this package builds rather than fills is the
keypair, and `keypair` below is where it is built, so that the module
holding the obligation to wipe one is the module that hands one out.

    """Overwrite what a cffi buffer views.

    The statement that writes the zeros, written once: `wipe` builds the
    view over a cdata, and `take` is already holding one it read the
    secret through, so calling `wipe` from there would build a second
    over the same memory.

    That it is a function and not the statement inlined in both places
    is a trade made deliberately and against the faster spelling.
    Measured over the same session as every other figure of this change,
    which CHANGELOG.md names: calling `wipe` a second time is 0.1826
    microseconds, this is 0.1439, and the inlined statement is 0.1314.
    So the frame gives up about a quarter of what is on the table, and
    what it buys is that the line which overwrites a secret exists once:
    two copies are two things to keep true, in the one facility whose
    whole claim is about what is left in memory.

    Args:
        memory: the `ffi.buffer` to overwrite, and a view of the whole
            cdata rather than a slice of one -- `wipe` builds it from
            the cdata for the reason its own docstring gives, and
            `_zero(ffi.buffer(buffer, 8))` would zero a quarter of the
            private key inside a keypair and report success, which is
            the failure that docstring records. Typed as the stub
            declares `ffi.buffer` to answer, this being the module that

def into_buffer(into: object, size: int) -> memoryview:
    """Hold a caller's buffer to what a secret is about to be written to.

    What is required is a buffer of exactly `size` writable, contiguous
    octets, and anything else is refused rather than adapted. The length
    is the one that matters: `into[:] = ...` of a short buffer raises
    anyway, but a caller who sized it by hand should be told what it
    should have been, and a *longer* one would take the secret in its
    first octets and leave whatever was in the rest -- which reads as a
    secret with a tail. A read-only view cannot be written and cannot be
    wiped either, so it would defeat the facility silently. Items wider
    than an octet are refused for the reason `_scalar.octets` refuses
    them: the view states a width this would not be honouring.

    Contiguity is two refusals rather than one, and neither is
    fastidious. A view of more than one dimension passes every other
    check -- `memoryview(bytearray(32)).cast("B", (4, 8))` is writable,
    octet-wide and 32 octets long -- and then fails the copy itself with
    `NotImplementedError`, which is neither of the two exceptions a
    caller was told to expect. A strided one *works*, and is refused all
    the same: `memoryview(bytearray(64))[::2]` would leave the secret
    scattered through 64 octets of an owner whose other 32 the caller
    has no reason to think are involved, and a wipe through the view
    would be right while a wipe of the owner would look right and not
    be.

    Anything the buffer protocol offers is otherwise accepted, an
    `mmap` and an `array.array("B")` included -- the first of those
    being a plausible destination, `mlock`ed, for exactly the caller
    this exists for. What refuses a non-buffer is `memoryview` itself.

    Typed `object` rather than `MutableBytesLike`, that being the
    annotation this exists to not trust: a caller is not obliged to run
    a type checker, and the whole job here is to answer what happens
    when they did not.
