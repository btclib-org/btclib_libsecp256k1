"""Tests for what the package exports.

Section 7 of the organization standard asks for `__all__` on every module
and package, "a module under a private name excepted as no part of that
surface", and a census walking the tree rather than listing it, "so a new
public name fails until it is exported or recorded" (#357,
btclib-org/.github#79). The modules sitting directly under
`btclib_secp256k1` are all in the census -- `_scalar`, `_secret` and
`_cdata` excepted by their own leading underscore -- and the walk below
has none of a sibling repository's own `tests/all_test.py`
group-or-unpublished partition, no module here re-exporting another by
name.

`zkp` is a subpackage, and the census descends into it: what it holds
wraps secp256k1-zkp the way the modules above wrap libsecp256k1, and a
census walking the tree is what section 7 asks for. The names declared
under it that are served by loading the flagged extension -- `zkp.ffi`,
`zkp.lib` and `zkp.context.ctx`, each a module-level `__getattr__` away
(`btclib_secp256k1/zkp/__init__.py`'s own docstring) -- raise
`ImportError` without `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP`, which `hasattr` does
not tolerate: it swallows `AttributeError` alone. `exported_name_exists`
below is what reads a name instead, and nothing this file imports
reaches for that extension (#627). `tests/zkp_test.py` is where the
subpackage's own behaviour is tested.

Every module's `ffi`, `lib`, `CData`, `BytesLike`, `MutableBytesLike` and
`ctx` come from `from . import ...` or `from .context import ctx`, which
is what a caller reaching past the argument-checked entry points needs --
SECURITY.md names that caller directly. That makes each of them an
import in every module except the one that defines it, so
`test_no_module_exports_a_name_it_imported` is what keeps one of them
from drifting into a second module's `__all__` by way of the same `from`
line that already binds it there.
