"""X-only public keys and their tweaking.

According to BIP340-Schnorr and to the BIP341 taproot key path:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki

An x-only public key is the 32-byte x coordinate of the point with even
y; the parity returned along a tweaked key is the one of the tweaked
point, to be committed to by the taproot output.

**A public key here is an x coordinate, and `02 || x`, `03 || x` and
`04 || x || y` all name it.** Every entry point taking a key takes any of
the three, and none of them consults the y: `lift_x` is the even-y point
whatever serialization the x arrived in, and a signer whose key is the
odd-y one signs with `n - d` for exactly that reason. So the parity is a
property of the serialization and not of the key, and there is no
discarding for an argument check to make visible -- `from_pubkey` returns
it because a caller converting a key it holds may want to know which of
the two forms it was handed, not because the two are different keys.

Which serialization to hand in is a question of cost and not of meaning:
`keys.parse` reads the uncompressed form for 0.269 us, both coordinates
being there, where the compressed form and the 32-byte one are a field
square root at 2.326.

# result: 0.1219 microseconds against 0.0681 for a literal cdecl -- an
# Apple M5, macOS 26.6, arm64, CPython 3.14.6, minimum of 15 rounds of
# 300 000 calls, on a noise row that moved 0.5%. A literal here would
# state the width a second time; `ffi.typeof` of the same f-string,
# evaluated once, is the literal's price with the width still stated
# once.
#
# What earns the name is the length rather than the cdecl. A name keeps
# two statements of one width in step, and a buffer whose bytes nothing
# unpacks states its width once already: naming that one would add a
# statement rather than remove one, so `ecdh.py`'s `ffi.new("char[32]")`
# and every other cdecl of that kind stay spelled in full. The price
# agrees and does not decide it: cffi already caches the parse of a
# literal cdecl, so hoisting one saves 0.003 -- 0.0656 against 0.0685,
# real at 4.3% and an order below the 0.054 above.
#
# Every buffer in this package whose bytes *are* unpacked is declared the
# way below -- an int constant, and `ffi.typeof` of it -- so that the
# width is stated once and `ffi.sizeof` of a cdata is not asked per
# call, `dsa`'s DER capacity excepted for the reason its own comment
# gives: 0.0690 against 0.0520 microseconds on the primitive alone. That
# is a session of its own, which CHANGELOG.md names, and every figure in
# the comments of `dsa`, `recovery`, `hashes`, `ellswift` and `ssa` comes
# from it rather than from the one above. At a call site it is 2.65% to
# 5.53% of the serializations in the first three of those -- 0.006 to
# 0.016 microseconds, which is neither one number nor the primitive's:
# within a session each noise row moves under 0.001, and across four
# sessions the same site moved by more than that, `dsa.serialize_compact`
# between 0.006 and 0.013. What is solid is a hundredth of a microsecond
# at a serialization, not a figure per site. In `ssa` and `ellswift` it is
# that same hundredth of calls of 15 to 31 microseconds, where timing a
# call against itself already moves as much or more: nothing those
# measurements resolve. `ellswift.create`, `ellswift._encode_`,
# `ssa._sign32` and `ssa._sign_custom` are spelled this way regardless,
# because a reader cannot see the cost of a host -- two spellings of one
# shape would leave the difference unexplainable at both of them
