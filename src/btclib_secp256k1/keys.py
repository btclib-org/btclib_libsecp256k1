    The names it is spelled with, in that order: a `pubkey_tweak_mul`

    equation -- u*H + v*Q of ECDSA and BIP340, MuSig2's aggregate of a
    key per signer, BIP352's tweak data -- and the whole of what it adds
    is that no product is serialized: written with the public halves,
    each `pubkey_tweak_mul` serializes 65 octets that the sum then
    parses again, and the terms are the only place a caller has to put
    them.

    The naive form of it, deliberately: a term at a time and one sum,
    with none of the shared precomputation of Strauss or Pippenger.
    libsecp256k1 has `secp256k1_ecmult_multi_var`, which is internal and
    not declared in `include/secp256k1.h`, so this is the only
    multi-scalar multiplication the public API can be composed of -- and
    the saving here is the crossing rather than the arithmetic, flat in
    the number of terms where a batched algorithm would grow with it.

    **This is the second function here that is more than one
    libsecp256k1 decision**, `xonly.from_prvkey` being the first, and
    the README's Design section says why the rule is what it is: the

    are `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_tweak_mul` and the sum is
    `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_combine`, in the one order that spells the
    equation -- and what is saved is a serialization and a parse per
    term, about a seventh of the call from three terms up and a little
    less at two.
    `PubkeyTweakChain` is an exception of the other kind and not of
    this one: its `tweak_add` is one decision and a serialization like
    every other, and what it holds is a parsed key across calls the
    caller makes one at a time.

    The infinity is `pubkey_sum`'s None, for the reason it is there and
    is more likely here: a verification equation is written to land on
    it, u*H + v*Q with v*Q the negation of u*H being the accepting case

    """Serialize an internal public key, in compressed form by default.

    Args:
        pubkey: the libsecp256k1 public key object, as `parse` returns.
        compressed: whether to return 33 bytes rather than 65.

    Returns:
        The 33-byte compressed serialization, or the 65-byte
        uncompressed one.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if libsecp256k1 refuses the object -- a NULL
            pointer, or a `secp256k1_pubkey` nothing has written to --
            or fails for any other reason, which a key it produced
            cannot make it do. Which of the two it was is on the thread
            rather than in the message, and `context.check` is what
            reads it.

    Example:
        >>> from btclib_secp256k1 import keys
        >>> uncompressed = keys.pubkey_from_prvkey(1, compressed=False)
        >>> keys.serialize(keys.parse(uncompressed)).hex()[:10]
        '0279be667e'

    # the width and the buffer's type are declared together at the top of
    # this module, each type built from the width beside it, so the two
    # cannot say different numbers and neither is worked out again here.
    # The flag is decided in the branch that picks the buffer, so the one
    # condition is asked once.
    #
    # What is unpacked is the buffer, not the length libsecp256k1 reports
    # back: this serialization has one length per flag, so a buffer of
    # the wrong size has to reach the caller to be caught -- reading the
    # reported length instead would quietly accept an oversized one,
    # which a mutation session measured directly (`char[34]` survives
    # that spelling, and dies in this one). The DER serialization is the
    # other case, and reads `length[0]` for the reason given there.
    #
    # The length *object* is built per call and not hoisted, though it
    # holds the same number every time: libsecp256k1 writes 0 into it
    # before it does anything (`*outputlen = 0` in secp256k1.c) and
    # restores it only on success, and it holds the value it finds there
    # against 33 or 65 on the way in. One failed call would leave a
    # shared buffer at zero, and every later serialization -- on any
    # thread, of a perfectly good key -- would be refused
