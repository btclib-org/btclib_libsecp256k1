    """Return the BIP340 nonce `sign` derives for a message and a key.

    libsecp256k1 exports its nonce function as a callable pointer, and
    this calls through it with what `secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign32`
    passes: the message, the key the signature is made with, the x-only
    public key, the `BIP0340/nonce` tag and the auxiliary randomness. So
    what comes back is the `k` of the signature `sign` makes of the same
    arguments -- the first 32 octets of that signature are the x of `k`
    times the generator, which is what `tests/nonces_test.py` holds it to.

    The key BIP340 signs with is the one of the even-y point, so a
    private key whose point has odd y enters the derivation negated, and
    the x-only public key with it. Both are derived here rather than
    asked of the caller: that is what makes the answer the nonce of the
    signature rather than of a key nobody signs with.

    It is here for the reason `dsa.nonce_rfc6979` is: a python
    implementation of BIP340's nonce derivation has published vectors and
    no oracle, and the aux is where implementations diverge.

    **The nonce is the secret the signature is built on**, and reading it
    into python takes it out of constant-time code: see
    `dsa.nonce_rfc6979`, which says what that means.

            derivation libsecp256k1 makes without any -- which answers
            what 32 zero octets answer, the tagged hash of those zeros
            being what it substitutes. `sign` given None generates 32
            fresh octets instead of passing none, so what reproduces a
            signature's nonce is the aux that signature was made with.
        into: a writable 32-byte buffer to receive the result, instead
            of the `bytes` this otherwise returns. See `_secret.take`
            and SECURITY.md for what that does and does not buy.

    Returns:
        The 32-byte nonce -- or None where `into` was given and holds it.

    `verify` is BIP340's own last step -- "If Verify(bytes(P), m, sig)
    returns failure, abort" -- and the one thing here that is more than a
    libsecp256k1 call. A computation gone wrong, memory gone bad or a
    fault induced on purpose, yields a signature that is invalid and may
    leak something about the secret key, and not answering with one is
    the whole of the protection. It is on by default because the BIP
    puts it inside the algorithm rather than beside it, and it can be
    turned off because the BIP says that too, "if the computation cost
    is prohibitive" -- which here is one verification and no

class Signer:
    """Sign under one private key repeatedly, building the keypair once.

    `sign` builds a `secp256k1_keypair` and wipes it before returning, so
    a caller signing a second message under the same key builds it again
    -- and that keypair is about half of what a BIP340 signature costs
    here, being the point multiplication of the public key. This holds
    one across calls instead, so the first signature is the only one
    paying for it, and `sign` and `sign_custom` are the same signatures
    over it. `pubkey()` is the x-only key those signatures verify
    against, read off that same keypair rather than derived a second
    time.

    What that hands the caller is the lifetime of a secret, and it is the
    trade this makes deliberately. A keypair is the private key in
    libsecp256k1's own layout, in memory this package owns and can
    overwrite; the two functions own one for the length of a call and
    wipe it in a `finally`, while a signer holds it until it is told to
    let go. `wipe` is that instruction, and the `with` statement is how
    to give it without having to remember: on the way out of the block
    the keypair is overwritten, whether the block ended in a signature or
    in an exception. A wiped signer refuses to sign rather than signing
    with the zeros, and it cannot be revived -- the private key is kept
    nowhere else here, which is the point -- so signing again means
    building another one.

    A signer told neither way is dropped holding the key: cffi frees the
    keypair without overwriting it, and nothing here runs behind it to
    do so. A finalizer would, at a time nothing specifies, which is a
    guarantee in the shape of one and not in fact -- so the instruction
    stays the caller's to give, and SECURITY.md records this as the one
    buffer of the package whose zeroing is asked for rather than done.

    What it does not change is the python side: the `bytes` or `int`
    handed in here is a python object like any other, and SECURITY.md
    records why that copy cannot be taken back.

    Args:
        prvkey: the private key, 32 bytes or an int below 2**256. Every

    Named for what it does rather than for what it asks: `_verify_` is
    thirty lines up, answers `bool` and is what a caller composes with,
    where this one raises and answers nothing. Two neighbours told apart
    by tense would invite `if _abort_unless_verified(...)`, which is
    syntactically fine and means nothing at all. The verb is BIP340's
    own -- "returns failure, abort".

    BIP340's *Default Signing* ends with this step -- "If Verify(bytes(P),
    m, sig) returns failure, abort" -- and says what it is for: a random
    or attacker provoked computation error yields a signature that is
    invalid and may leak something about the secret key, and not
    publishing one is the whole of the protection. Schnorr is linear, so
    what leaks is not vague: two signatures over one nonce and two
    challenges give up `d` by subtraction. The BIP puts the step inside
    the algorithm and allows omitting it where the cost is prohibitive,
    which is why `sign` does it unless told not to rather than the other
    way round.

    Written once because `_sign32` and `_sign_custom` both end in it, and
    because the key has to be the one that signed: two spellings would be
    two chances for it to be some other key, and a check against the
    wrong key proves nothing while looking like proof.

    The key is read off the keypair rather than derived, which is what
    makes this cheaper than the same step is in `dsa`: BIP340 needs the
    public key to sign at all, so the multiplication is already paid and
    what is left is the verification.
