"""`secp256k1_rangeproof.h`: proving a commitment's value lies in a range.

A Borromean-ring-signature variant of the Back-Maxwell range proofs from
the Confidential Assets paper, over a `zkp.generator.pedersen_commit`
commitment rather than the value itself: `sign` authors a proof that the
committed value lies in `[min_value, min_value + 2**mantissa)`, `verify`
checks one, and `rewind` recovers what `sign`'s own author embedded --
the value, the blinding factor and up to `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN` bytes of
message -- from a proof made with a matching nonce. `info` reads the
public part of a proof without either.

`MAX_MESSAGE_LEN` is the one constant the header itself fixes
(`SECP256K1_RANGEPROOF_MAX_MESSAGE_LEN`); the other size this module
needs, the worst-case proof buffer, has no such `#define` -- it is what
`secp256k1_rangeproof_max_size` answers, and `sign` asks the library for
it rather than carrying a copy of the 5134 the header's own comment and
zkp's `tests_impl.h` state as today's answer, which is not a promise
about tomorrow's. `MAX_MESSAGE_LEN` cannot be asked of the library the
same way: nothing in `secp256k1_rangeproof.h` exposes it as a function,
and cffi's own cdef generation (`generate_def`'s `gcc -P -E`) preprocesses
every `#define` away before `lib` is built from what remains, so no
runtime call could read it even if this module wanted one to. The
literal is what stands in its place, and a submodule bump that moved it
would go unnoticed by anything here.

Every function here needs `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP`'s extension, and none
of them reaches for it at import time, for the reason
`btclib_secp256k1.zkp.generator`'s own module docstring gives.

`rewind` takes its blinding factor out through
`btclib_secp256k1._secret.take`, the same cross-`ffi`-safe function
`zkp.generator`'s own module docstring names, but offers no `into`: the
blinding factor is one member of the 5-tuple `rewind` answers, where an
argument could not say which -- SECURITY.md gives the same reason for
the two `silentpayments` secrets that offer none either.
