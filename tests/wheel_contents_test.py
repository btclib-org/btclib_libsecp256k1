"""Tests for the wheel-content check of `.github/scripts`.

What CI can show is that a real build passes: `test.yml`'s `check-dist`
job runs the script on every wheel it downloads. What CI cannot show is
that anything *fails* -- a wheel with a second compiled extension in it
is not something a workflow can produce on purpose -- so the archives
here are synthetic, one member planted per rule, and the assertion is
the complaint.

The last two tests ask a different question: whether
`docs/source/package-content-policy.md` states the same policy. A page
beside a script is a second copy of one list, and two copies are one
that can be wrong -- the page saying `.so` is a shared-library suffix
while the script's tuple does not carry it, with nothing to notice.
Those two compare the page against the script's own constants in both
directions, the same way a sibling repository's own
`tests/verify_dist_contents_test.py` does; the parsing helpers below
are copied from there rather than written twice, the two pages having
the same "list stated by the paragraph naming it" shape.

The script is loaded by path, `.github/scripts` being no package, as
`submodule_pin_test.py` loads its own subject.
