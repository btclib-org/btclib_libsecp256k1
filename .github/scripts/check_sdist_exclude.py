"""No sdist `exclude` entry matches a tracked file, bar the deliberate ones.

check-sdist (henryiii/check-sdist) compares the sdist hatchling builds
against `git ls-files --cached --recurse-submodules`, and its hatchling
plugin then subtracts from that comparison whatever
`[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]`'s own `exclude` list matches
(`check_sdist/backends/hatchling.py`'s `git_only_excludes`, called
unconditionally inside `compare()` at v1.6.0, regardless of
`[tool.check-sdist]`'s `mode`). An entry matching a tracked file
therefore drops that file from the sdist with check-sdist quiet about
it, whatever the file is and wherever it lives
(btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#655).

Some of that subtraction is meant, and `_DELIBERATE` below is where the
file it drops on purpose is named. That tuple is what lets this check
match the exclude list against every tracked file rather than against a
subset picked to leave `/COPYRIGHT` out: a match outside it fails, and
so does a member of it the list matches nothing for, so it cannot drift
from the list it names exemptions from
(btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#770).

Every tracked file is the scope because this repository's own sources
are as reachable by a hand-written entry as a submodule's are:
`/_btclib_secp256k1.*` is anchored, and `pyproject.toml`'s comment
beside it names the tracked `stubs/_btclib_secp256k1.pyi` that the
unanchored spelling takes out of the sdist -- a file the strict mypy
gate needs. This check fails on that spelling.

It fires only where an entry matches a file that is *currently tracked*,
so an entry naming a local build's own debris, which is untracked,
leaves it quiet: most of the list names what `./autogen.sh &&
./configure` writes inside a submodule, and no clone carries any of it.
That asymmetry is also why `[tool.check-sdist]`'s `mode = "all"` -- one
of the two other answers #655 named and did not choose between -- is not
this one: `mode` decides what `compare()` treats as "git" (`git ls-files`
under `"git"`, every file on disk under `"all"`), but `git_only_excludes`
runs after that choice and unconditionally either way, so it subtracts
the same tracked file under both -- measured against
`check_sdist/__main__.py`'s own `compare()`, `mode` never reaching that
call at all. The third, an upstream request that the plugin report what
it subtracts, remains open against henryiii/check-sdist and would retire
this hook if it landed; nothing here depends on it landing.

Regex rather than `tomllib` for the exclude list: the floor here is
3.10, and `tomllib` is 3.11 -- `tests/copyright_test.py`'s own module
docstring gives the same reason for the same choice.

    """Return `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]`'s `exclude` list.

    A line-based walk rather than one regex spanning the whole array: a
    comment inside the array is free to hold a `]` of its own (this
    file's own comments cite `[tool.check-sdist]`, brackets included),
    which a single "up to the next `]`" pattern would stop at instead of
    the array's real close. Reading line by line and trusting only a
    line that is *exactly* `]` -- this table's own closing convention --
    to end the array is what keeps such a comment from being mistaken
    for the end.

    The rest of that convention is read just as literally: the array
    opens on a line ending in `[`, and every entry is one double-quoted
    string with a trailing comma, alone on its line, with blank lines
    and whole-line comments free to sit between entries. Anything else
    is refused rather than answered, a walk this simple seeing not
    *less* of another shape but something else. Read rather than
    refused, an inline `exclude = ["a", "b"]` would never leave the
    array, harvesting every double-quoted string down to the next lone
    `]` out of tables it never entered; a `]` carrying a trailing
    comment leaves it inside the array the same way; a single-quoted
    entry offers no double-quoted run to find and would drop out; and a
    comment sharing a line with an entry would add whatever *it* quotes.
    Each of those is a different pattern set, and a caller matching one
    reports nothing wrong about a list it never read.

        own hatchling plugin (`git_only_excludes`) uses, so this reads
        the identical question it answers; or None where the array is
        outside the shape above, which is a check that cannot answer
