"""Silent Payments.

According to BIP352:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki

What libsecp256k1 implements, and therefore what is wrapped here, is the
elliptic curve half of the protocol: the sum of the input keys, the
Diffie-Hellman shared secret, and the outputs and tweaks derived from it.
Addresses, output script types and transaction parsing are not part of
it -- which is why every function here takes keys and a serialized
outpoint rather than a transaction, and why deciding which inputs are
eligible, and which of the eligible ones are taproot, is the caller's:
BIP352 states those rules over scripts, and there is no script here.

This is the module with the most keys to parse per call, and so the one
where the private halves earn the most: a wallet scanning block after
block parses each of its own keys once and hands the objects to
`_scan_outputs_`, where `scan_outputs` parses the spend key and every
transaction output again at every transaction.

#
# Public, where widths stated only to size a buffer are private, and the
# question those answer is a different one: `xonly.py` states its own for
# the buffer it unpacks, and nothing outside the module needs it. This
# module answers a caller lengths of its own (#232). `SUMMARY_SIZE` is
# the one that has to be public: it is `ffi.sizeof` of a struct, no BIP
# writes it down, it moves when libsecp256k1 moves, and a caller holding
# what `prevouts_summary` returned can learn how many octets that is
# nowhere else -- its docstring shows the check. `LABEL_SIZE` is 33
# because a label is a compressed point, so a caller could work it out
# where it could not work the other out; what keeps it public is that it
# has been since 0.8.0, and taking a released name private to tidy an
# asymmetry is a break charged to a reader who never asked.
# `keys._COMPRESSED_SIZE` is the same 33 and stays private: nothing there
# checks a caller's argument against it, where two callers' arguments are
# checked against this one -- `parse_label`'s octets and the labels
# `_fill_label_cache` takes for `_scan_outputs_`. What `serialize_label`

    The private half of `scan_outputs`: see the package docstring for
    what the two underscores mean throughout. A wallet scanning every
    transaction of a block parses its own spend key once here, where the
    public half parses it once per transaction, and takes the summary
    `_prevouts_summary_` built rather than octets to be written back into
    a struct.

    What it answers is octets even so: an output's tweak is a secret this
    call takes back out of libsecp256k1's memory before returning, and
    its x-only key is 32 bytes a caller compares rather than computes
    with.

        tx_outputs: the already-parsed x-only public keys of the
            transaction's taproot outputs, in vout order, as
            `xonly.parse` returns. At least one is required.

            int below 2**256.
        summary: the summary of the transaction's inputs, as

        labels: the recipient's label cache, mapping each 33-byte label
            to its 32-byte tweak, or None where no labeled address was
            published.

    Returns:

        public key, the 32-byte tweak to add to the spend private key to
        spend it, and the 33-byte label it was found with, or None where
        it was paid to the unlabeled address.
