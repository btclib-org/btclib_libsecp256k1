"""Pure python cffi bindings to libsecp256k1: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.

Every entry point of these bindings takes octets and answers octets. A
libsecp256k1 object crosses the boundary only where a caller already
holds one, and there are two ways it can. The first is a `parse`:
`keys.parse` and `keys.serialize`, and the pairs beside them in `xonly`,
`dsa`, `recovery` and `silentpayments`, are that bridge, and a MuSig2
session driven through the raw `lib` is who is on the other side of it.

The second is a keypair, which has no bridge because it has no
serialization to be one: `secp256k1_keypair` holds a private key in
libsecp256k1's own layout, and the C API creates one and never writes it
out. A caller that built one -- through `lib`, as a MuSig2 signer does --
holds an object nothing here could have handed it as octets, and
`xonly.from_keypair` is what reads the public key off it.
`ssa.Signer.pubkey` is that same call for a caller that let this package
build the keypair instead.

Under each of those entry points is the half of it that speaks in those
objects, spelled `_foo_`. The leading underscore says private, because
an object is a promise no argument check can hold a caller to: what can
be proved of a bare pointer's contents is nothing, and what answers for
it is libsecp256k1 itself, through the illegal callback -- which these
wrappers do not read, so a private half handed an object libsecp256k1
cannot use answers whatever that call answers: its own exception where a
return code allowed one, and otherwise a `False`, an ordering or a
shared secret that mean nothing. `context.check` immediately after the
call is what says so, and the public entry point above is the one with
no such case, having parsed the octets itself. The trailing one says
which kind of
private, `_verify_` taking a parsed key where `_parse_der` is an
ordinary helper. `foo` is `_foo_` with a parse in front of it, a
serialize behind it, or both, which is the equality
`tests/parsed_keys_test.py` holds every pair to; what the private half
saves is what composing two public ones pays between them, a
serialization of a point that was already in hand and a parse of what
was just serialized -- and for a compressed key that parse is a field
square root.
