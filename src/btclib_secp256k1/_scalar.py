    Both halves of that, and they are one question. The length, because
    libsecp256k1 reads a fixed number of octets from a pointer whose
    length never reached C to be checked. The type, because `len`
    answers for anything with a length: a `bytearray` of 32 passed the
    size check on its own and left cffi to refuse it one call later, in
    its own words and about a ctype -- `initializer for ctype 'unsigned
    char *' must be a cdata pointer` -- which names neither the argument
    nor what was wrong with it. A `float` did not even get that far, and
    came back as `object of type 'float' has no len()`.

    A `bytearray` and a `memoryview` are converted rather than refused,
    and that is not the leniency the short value is: they state a value
    and a width, both of them, so nothing has to be disbelieved and
    nothing supplied. The `int` this package already accepts for a
    scalar is the wider door of the two, the 32-octet width being the
    curve's rather than the caller's. What the conversion is not is a
    pass-through: the copy is taken here, so a caller who overwrites
    their own buffer -- which is the reason to hold a secret in a
    mutable one -- cannot change what libsecp256k1 is about to read.

def _owned_octets(num: CData, name: str) -> CData:
    """Accept 32 octets of memory the caller owns, unconverted.

    The one argument of these bindings that is not copied on the way in,
    and the reason is what a copy would be: an immutable `bytes` of a
    secret, which nothing can overwrite and which stays until the
    collector gets to it. A caller holding the key in memory it can zero
    -- `ffi.new("unsigned char[32]")`, wiped with `_secret.wipe` -- would
    otherwise have one made per call, so what `octets` is right to do for
    a value is wrong for this one.

    What that gives up is stated where `octets` states the opposite: the
    copy taken there is what stops a caller overwriting their own buffer
    while libsecp256k1 reads it. **Obligations pass to the caller with
    the copy**, and none of them exists for a `bytes`:

    - the octets stay put for the whole call, and the whole call is more
      than one read. `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign` loads the scalar
      (`secp256k1/src/secp256k1.c:555`) and then hands the same pointer
      to the nonce derivation (:563), and above it `dsa._sign_` reads it
      again for every grinding attempt and once more in `_checked`'s
      failing branch. So a write in between is not "a different key
      signed": it is a nonce and a signature derived from two different
      keys, which arrives as the fault `RuntimeError` and looks like
      hardware;
    - the memory outlives the call, which no python argument has ever had
      to promise. A cdata view does not keep its owner alive:
      `ffi.new("unsigned char[64]")[0:32]` and `ffi.cast(...)` over a
      temporary read freed memory, measured -- zeros here by the
      allocator's grace, and a plausible scalar on a busier heap. What
      this function returns is safe in that respect, `from_buffer`
      keeping its view alive, but it cannot rescue a dangling argument;
    - the declaration is the truth about the length, because `ffi.sizeof`
      answers what the *type* says rather than what was allocated:
      `ffi.cast("unsigned char[32]", <8 octets>)` clears every refusal
      below and has libsecp256k1 read 24 octets of whatever follows.
      cffi has nothing to check that against, so neither has this.

    The alternative on offer is the copy that cannot be wiped, which is
    why the trade is a caller's to make and not a default.

    Any 1-octet array is taken, whatever the caller declared it as, and
    what makes that safe is a re-view rather than a conversion:
    `ffi.from_buffer` over `ffi.buffer` answers an `unsigned char[32]`
    pointing at the caller's own memory, which is the one item type cffi
    will pass to `const unsigned char *`. Without it the acceptance would
    be `char` and `unsigned char` alone -- cffi holds `uint8_t` and
    `signed char` to be primitives of their own, so `uint8_t[32]`, which
    is what a C programmer writes for 32 octets, would clear every check
    here and die at the boundary in cffi's words.

    **Not `ffi.cast`, and this is the trap in the neighbourhood.** It
    would answer the same pointer for nothing, and it does not keep the
    memory alive: a cast whose owner is dropped reads freed memory, which
    was measured rather than read off the documentation -- 32 octets that
    no longer hold the key, with no error anywhere. `from_buffer` keeps a
    reference to what it views, and the buffer it views keeps the cdata,
    so the chain holds for as long as the value is in use.

    Which shapes are refused is the whole of the care here, because what
    follows is a bare pointer libsecp256k1 reads 32 octets from:

    - a *pointer* rather than an array, whose `ffi.sizeof` is 8 on this
      machine and says nothing about what it points at. That is the trap
      `_secret.wipe` records from the other side, where `ffi.sizeof`
      would have wiped a quarter of a private key and reported success
    - an array whose items are wider than an octet. `uint32_t[8]` is 32
      octets of whatever this machine's byte order made of them, which
      is exactly what `octets` refuses a `memoryview` of wider items
      for, and refused rather than reinterpreted for the same reason
    - an array of the wrong length, which is the check every other
      scalar gets and the one a bare pointer cannot be given later

    Args:
        num: the cdata, as the caller passed it.
        name: what the scalar is, as the exception should call it.

    Returns:

    An int is serialized big endian, as libsecp256k1 expects; anything
    `octets` takes goes to it. The length is checked there because
    libsecp256k1 takes a bare pointer and would read past the end of a
    shorter one. A short value is not padded to that length while an int
    is serialized to it, and the asymmetry is not a leniency: 20 octets
    state a value and a width, one of which would have to be
    disbelieved, whereas an int states only a value and the width is the
    curve's.

    A cffi array of 32 octets is the one thing not copied. It is memory
    the caller owns and can overwrite, so converting it would make the
    copy that cannot be -- `_owned_octets` is that decision, what it
    refuses, and the re-view that lets any 1-octet spelling through.
    Where libsecp256k1 writes through the pointer instead of reading it,
    or where this package wipes the buffer afterwards, a copy is owed and
    `_secret.scalar_buffer` is the one that takes it.

    Where it matters is not the per-signature path, the private halves
    handing libsecp256k1 the pointer without coming through here at all,
    but the *derivation*:
    `keys._pubkey_from_prvkey_` asks for a scalar, so a key held in a
    buffer has its public key derived from the buffer itself -- and
    `dsa._checked`'s failing branch, which derives in order to tell a
    wrong argument from a fault, gives that diagnosis rather than a
    `TypeError` about the argument.

    A secret is better passed as bytes, for a narrow reason. Not the
    serialization, which is a loop over nine CPython digits and measures
    as noise, but the python arithmetic that produced the int, variable
    in time with the magnitude of its operands and leaving unzeroized
    copies of every intermediate on the heap — all of it before this
    call. bytes are not zeroized either, so what they buy is only that
    no arithmetic on the secret happened here; scalar arithmetic that
