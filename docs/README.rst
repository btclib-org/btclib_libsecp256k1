Generate btclib_secp256k1 documentation with Sphinx
=======================================================

Sphinx is a powerful documentation generator that
has many great features for writing technical documentation.

Quick start
-----------

uv installs sphinx, the theme, and this package itself. That last part
is the one that matters, and it takes longer here than in btclib's own
build: every directive under ``source/`` is an ``automodule``, so sphinx
imports the package in order to document it, and that means compiling
the vendored libsecp256k1 -- the git submodule and a C toolchain, as the
main README's Build section describes -- not merely installing pure
Python. A module sphinx cannot import gets a bare heading and nothing
beneath it.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ git submodule update --init
    $ uv sync --locked --no-default-groups --group docs

``--locked`` is what holds the resolution ``uv.lock`` pins: without it
the project is re-locked before the sync, and ``uv.lock`` is tracked, so
a lockfile out of step with ``pyproject.toml`` is rewritten rather than
reported. The groups are the build's own below and belong here as well:
``uv run`` adds what its groups ask for and removes nothing else, so a
wider sync leaves the build here running in an environment read the docs
does not have.

A sync is exact, so this one narrows ``.venv`` to the ``docs`` group:
mypy, ruff, pre-commit and pytest go with the groups
``CONTRIBUTING.md``'s own ``uv sync --locked`` installs, and
``.vscode/settings.json`` has the editor's type checker reading this
``.venv``. ``uv sync --locked`` puts them back.

Build from the project root, exactly as ``.readthedocs.yaml`` does:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group docs \
          sphinx-build -n -W -b html docs/source docs/build/html

Open ``docs/build/html/index.html`` in a browser to see the result. The
``Makefile`` and ``make.bat`` here drive the same build, from within this
directory and without the flags:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ cd docs
    $ uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group docs make clean html

``-W`` is not decoration: without it a module that fails to import is a
warning and nothing more, and the published documentation silently has
no API in it. Read the docs builds with the same flag, so a build that
is green here is green there. ``-n`` turns an unresolved cross-reference
into a warning for ``-W`` to fail on -- without it a renamed class or a
moved function in a role such as ``:class:`` builds green and links
nowhere.

Adding or removing a module
----------------------------

Edit ``btclib_secp256k1.rst`` by hand. Do **not** run ``sphinx-apidoc
-f -o docs/source src/btclib_secp256k1/``: ``-f`` regenerates the page
from the template, discarding the ``myst`` links to README,
RELEASE_NOTES, CONTRIBUTING and SECURITY that ``index.rst`` carries.
Point it at a scratch directory if you want the boilerplate for a new
module, then copy the stanza across.

Forgetting the edit is what ``tests/docs_test.py`` is for: it compares
the modules under ``src/btclib_secp256k1/`` against the directives in
``docs/source/`` and fails naming whichever is missing. This note is
the convenience; the test is the guarantee.

Dependencies
------------

There is no ``docs/requirements.txt``, and there is no place for one:
the build, locally and on read the docs alike, is uv with ``--locked``,
so the ``docs`` dependency group in ``pyproject.toml`` is the single
declaration and ``uv.lock`` pins it. A requirements file would be a
second copy, kept in step by hand and read by nothing.
