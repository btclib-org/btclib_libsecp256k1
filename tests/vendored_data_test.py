"""What `tests/README.md` must not say about itself.

The same claim a sibling repository's own `vendored_data_test.py`
forbids, for the same reason: a stated count is a line every open
branch has to edit, so
a pull request vendoring a fourth file is guaranteed to conflict on it,
and the Summary's own `git ls-files` command already answers the
question on demand. The lists stay; the number in front of them goes.
