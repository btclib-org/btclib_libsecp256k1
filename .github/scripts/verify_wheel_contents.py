r"""Check a built wheel against an allowlist of its members.

`twine check`, `check-wheel-contents` and `pyroma` read the *metadata* of
a wheel: whether it is syntactically valid, whether the long description
renders, whether the classifiers a package should declare are there.
None of them reads every member, and what is in the archive is what a
user installs.

`check-wheel-contents --package btclib_secp256k1`, the same option a
sibling repository's own `pyproject.toml` configures for its own
package, is the closest built-in answer, and it does not fit here: it
diffs the wheel's whole library against the one named package tree,
and this package's wheel is not one package tree. Every wheel this
project ships also carries a compiled artifact at the wheel's own
root, beside `btclib_secp256k1/` rather than inside it -- the
extension module for a static wheel, that module's ABI-mode source and
the shared `libsecp256k1` for a dynamic one -- which `--package` reports
as "files not in package tree" whether or not they are the ones this
project intends. `[tool.check-wheel-contents]` keeps `ignore = ["W003",
"W009"]` for the same reason, on the dynamic wheel specifically: the
checks those codes name are about a *non-package* file at the top level,
which for this project's dynamic wheel is not a mistake but the shared
library.

Three questions, and what answers them:

**Which top-level artifact must be there.** A wheel's tag says whether it
is static (an `infer_tag`ed `cpNN-...`, one compiled extension) or
dynamic (`py3-none-<platform>`, an ABI-mode module and the shared library
beside it) -- `scripts/hatch_build.py`'s own distinction, and this reads
the same tag it writes. Which artifacts a wheel of that kind must carry,
and refusing an extra one -- a stray file that is not part of
`btclib_secp256k1/` and not one of them -- is what `--package` cannot
phrase without also refusing the artifact that belongs.

**Whether the artifact is really there**, and not a zero-byte member a
half-finished build step left behind: `scripts/cffi_build.py` raises when
it cannot find one to copy, not when it copies an empty one, so an empty
file is a shape that check has no report for. `toplevel_reason` below
checks the kind-appropriate artifact for size as well as presence, which
none of `check-wheel-contents`'s codes do for any member.

**Whether `btclib_secp256k1/` itself is complete.** Everything under
that directory in the wheel has to be everything the checkout has under
it -- source, `py.typed`, nothing more and nothing less -- which is
`--package`'s own question, asked here by hand rather than through a
flag that would also judge the sibling artifact.

The sdist is not this script's subject. A sibling repository's own
script checks it because `MANIFEST.in` there is an *include* list -- a
file the tree gains and MANIFEST.in does not name is a file the sdist
silently drops, which is the failure this whole class of check exists
for.
`[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist] exclude` here is the opposite shape: a
file the tree gains ships by default, and has to be named to be left
out, so the failure mode is an sdist too wide rather than one silently
narrow. What that leaves unchecked -- an exclude pattern that lists a
file this build still needs -- is a build failure, not a silent gap,
which is a different question with a different check to answer it.

Run it against one built wheel:

    uv run --no-project --python 3.14 \\
        .github/scripts/verify_wheel_contents.py dist/*.whl

`test.yml`'s `check-dist` job runs it on every wheel it downloads --
`build-cibuildwheel`, `build-dynamic` and `build-windows` between them --
which are the artifacts `release.yml`'s own `test` job produces and the
publish jobs upload: one build, checked and shipped, so this judges the
files this project actually publishes rather than a copy of them.
