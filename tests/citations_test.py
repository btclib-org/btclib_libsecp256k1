"""A test this package names in its prose is a test that exists.

The prose here points at tests by name -- the module docstring of
`tests/verified_signing_test.py` names several, and
`src/btclib_secp256k1/dsa.py` names cases behind a claim it makes about
itself -- and nothing
said whether the name still belonged to anything. #256 was two landmarks
that had come to point at the wrong test, and naming the test instead of
its position is better only until a rename: an append falsifies a
position, a rename falsifies a name, and neither turns anything red.

What is read is every backticked span in the sources, whitespace collapsed
out of it, that then spells a test name. Text rather than the syntax tree,
which inverts `tests/secret_test.py`'s reasoning for the opposite
population: there a mention had to be told from a call, so the names come
off the AST; here the mention *is* the subject, and half of them are in
comments the AST does not carry.

Two shapes make the reader what it is rather than a one-line pattern:

- **a citation wrapped by the reflow.** `tests/docs_test.py` cites
  `test_no_documented_module_has_gone_away` broken at an underscore across
  two lines. A pattern anchored to one line does not report it as dangling
  -- it never sees it, which is the failure a guard must not have -- so the
  span is collapsed before it is compared, of whitespace and of the `#` a
  wrap inside a comment block adds. What collapsing costs is stated in
  `_cited`.
- **a name that is not ours.** `tests/vectors_test.py` cites
  rust-secp256k1's own `test_low_r` to say which upstream vector it
  reproduces: correct prose that resolves to nothing here. Those are named
  in `_FOREIGN`, with where each comes from, and each is asserted to still
  be cited by something other than this file -- an exemption that stops
  applying fails rather than sitting there, which it could not do if the
  prose explaining it counted as a use.

`CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` are out of scope, and not for the
citations they would add. A released section is that release's
account of itself, so a test renamed afterwards does not make it wrong,
and a check over it would ask for the record to be edited whenever the
tree moves -- rewriting history rather than fixing a reference.

The open section is out of scope for a reason of its own rather than by
extension: the entry renaming every module under `tests/` states that
`CHANGELOG.md` is where the names as they were survive, and gives
`git grep` answering it alone as what the rename buys.
