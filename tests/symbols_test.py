"""A libsecp256k1 symbol this repository names is a symbol upstream declares.

`tests/citations_test.py` holds a test name written in this tree's prose to
a test that exists. Nothing did the same for the other family of names this
prose is full of: the libsecp256k1 and secp256k1-zkp symbols that
docstrings and comments name to say which C entry point they are about.
That class rots on a submodule bump rather than on a rename here, so no
author is in a position to notice it -- `src/btclib_secp256k1/ssa.py` named
`secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign` twice after the mainline pin move removed the
alias, found by hand while measuring something else (closes #805, issue
#796).

What is read out of this repository's own files is every run of
`secp256k1_[a-z0-9_]+` and `SECP256K1_[A-Z0-9_]+`, and what it is checked
against is every name a `.h`, `.c`, `CMakeLists.txt` or `.cmake` file under
`secp256k1/` or `secp256k1-zkp/` spells the same way.

## The oracle has to exclude upstream's own prose

Measured, and it is the trap: an oracle built from *every* file in the
vendored trees answers "present" for `secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign`, because
upstream's own `CHANGELOG.md` records removing it. Such a check passes on
the very defect it exists for. Restricting the oracle to `.h`, `.c`,
`CMakeLists.txt` and `.cmake` is what makes it work --
`test_the_oracle_excludes_what_upstream_removed` is the control that keeps
it working: the restricted oracle does not have the alias, and
`secp256k1/CHANGELOG.md` -- the file that would leak it into an
unrestricted oracle -- does, so the absence above is the restriction's
doing and not a typo in the name being looked for.

## CMake options are read as declarations, not exempted

`SECP256K1_VALGRIND`, `SECP256K1_ASM`, `SECP256K1_ECMULT_WINDOW_SIZE`,
`SECP256K1_ECMULT_GEN_KB`, `SECP256K1_BUILD_CTIME_TESTS` and
`SECP256K1_USE_EXTERNAL_DEFAULT_CALLBACKS` are declared in `CMakeLists.txt`
and `cmake/`, not in C, so an oracle built from `.h` and `.c` alone would
report every one of them absent. The alternative to widening the oracle is
exempting them by name, which is weaker: a rename upstream gives one of
them would go unnoticed either way, where reading the declaration catches
it the same way `tests/module_flags_test.py` already reads
`option(SECP256K1_ENABLE_MODULE_*)` out of the same files rather than
hand-listing the modules.

## A trailing underscore is a glob, not a name

`secp256k1_musig_*`, `secp256k1_generator_*`, `secp256k1_pedersen_*`,
`SECP256K1_ENABLE_MODULE_*` and `SECP256K1_CHECKMEM_*` appear in prose as
prefixes, one entry point or one CMake option among several. Stripping the
`*` before matching leaves the prefix looking like a name this repository
invented and the submodule never declared, so a mention ending in `*` is
read as a prefix instead: `test_no_prefix_glob_has_gone_stale` holds each
one to still resolving to at least one real name in the oracle, so a
prefix nothing matches any more fails rather than sitting there.

## What counts as this repository's prose

`CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` are out of scope, for the reasons
`tests/citations_test.py` gives for exempting them from its own sweep: a
released section is that release's own account of itself, and the open
section is where the record of a name as it used to be survives a rename
here.

A `.py` file is read for its comments and its module, class and function
docstrings, not for the rest of its text: `scripts/cffi_build.py` and
`tests/module_flags_test.py` both hold real `secp256k1_*` and
`SECP256K1_*` substrings in code that is not a citation -- a CLI flag such
as `-DSECP256K1_ENABLE_MODULE_ECDH=ON`, a header filename such as
`secp256k1_ecdh.h`, a regular expression built to *match* a declaration
rather than to name one. Every one of those is a value this package
computes with, checked by building and importing the extension, not a
claim in prose that can go stale on a submodule bump. Every other file
this repository tracks is read whole.

## Prose wraps

A citation is not always backticked -- `ssa.py`'s `EXTRAPARAMS_MAGIC`
comment names `SECP256K1_SCHNORRSIG_EXTRAPARAMS_MAGIC` with no backticks
around it -- so the reader here matches raw text rather than a delimited
span, and a line-oriented pattern would not see a name the reflow wrapped
across two lines. `tests/citations_test.py` names the shape: a wrap always
falls at an underscore, so the continuation line always starts with one.
That is what lets a wrap be told apart from two unrelated words that
simply landed on either side of a line break, which do not: the line
above a wrap is collapsed into the one below it only where what follows
the break, once a leading `#` and indentation are stripped, is an
underscore.
