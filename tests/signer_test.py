"""A signer signs what the module functions sign, and then wipes.

`ssa.Signer` is one of the two module functions with the keypair hoisted
out of it, so what has to hold is an equality -- signature for signature,
message length for message length -- and that equality is what the
published BIP340 vectors already pin on the other side: tests/
vectors_test.py signs each vector through a signer as well as through
`ssa.sign_custom`, so the value both are held against comes from
bitcoin/bips rather than from this package agreeing with itself.

What is left for this file is the half a vector cannot state: the
lifetime the signer hands the caller. The keypair is the private key in
libsecp256k1's layout, in memory this package owns, so what is asserted
here is that it is still there while the signer is usable, that `wipe`
and the `with` block each overwrite it, that a wiped signer refuses to
sign instead of signing with the zeros, and that a signer told neither is
dropped with the secret still in it -- the limit SECURITY.md names, held
to by a test so that closing it later is a decision rather than a
sentence quietly made false.
