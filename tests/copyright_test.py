"""LICENSE, COPYRIGHT and pyproject.toml, checked against each other.

A sibling repository's own LICENSE named "Ferdinando M. Ametrano and
btclib contributors" for years after the rest of that project had
moved to "The btclib developers", with nothing comparing the two
(btclib-org/btclib#389). LICENSE here named "Giacomo Caironi" the same
way, against this project's own COPYRIGHT and `authors` already saying
"The btclib developers" -- caught by hand, not by a check, which is what
this one is.

`[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-copyright]`'s `notice-rgx` is COPYRIGHT's text
transcribed by hand as a regex, and the CPY hook it configures checks
every source file's header against the regex rather than against the
file it was transcribed from: a COPYRIGHT edited without the regex, or
the other way round, passes every gate (btclib-org/.github#135).

Regex rather than `tomllib` for the lines wanted out of pyproject.toml:
the floor here is 3.10, and `tomllib` is 3.11. Once that floor moves,
this can read the file directly instead.
