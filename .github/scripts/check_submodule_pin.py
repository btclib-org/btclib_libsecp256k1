"""The vendored libsecp256k1 is the release README.md says it is.

`version-check` in .github/workflows/release.yml asks this of upstream,
over the network, and refuses to publish when the answer is no. That is
the last gate before publication and it stays. What this is, is the same
question asked of every commit instead of every release, so that a
submodule bump and the prose about it cannot disagree for the length of
a cycle -- which is the window in which CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md
and README.md are written about the version nobody has confirmed.

Offline is what makes it a hook rather than a workflow step. The tag is
resolved in the vendored clone, whose refs are already on the machine, so
nothing here reaches the network and nothing goes red because github.com
is unreachable. The half only the network can answer -- that the tag is
upstream's, and that its signature is a maintainer's -- is the job of the
same name in .github/workflows/vendored-vectors.yml, which is a sentinel
for exactly that reason.

Two commands, and what they answer:

    git ls-tree HEAD secp256k1          the commit this tree pins
    git -C secp256k1 rev-parse <tag>^{commit}   what README.md's tag is

Run by the `submodule-pin` hook of .pre-commit-config.yaml, and so by the
lint workflow, on every commit rather than on the two paths that can
break the agreement: pre-commit cannot filter on the gitlink, for the
reason that hook's own comment gives, and two git invocations are cheap
enough that it does not have to.

README.md is the one declared value, on purpose: btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#429
asked whether the wrapped release should live there or in a fourth,
machine-written place, and the answer is that README.md stays it. The
submodule pin is already the machine's ground truth -- what this hook and
`version-check` both resolve a tag against -- so a fourth file would only
be one more thing to move in step with the submodule, not a smaller
number of places that read it. What README.md's prose gives that the pin
alone cannot is a human-legible claim of which release that commit is,
which is what `release.yml` and `vendored-vectors.yml` compare it
against too, each with its own copy of `_NAMED` (the three are named in
#429; a fix to the parsing is owed to all of them in one campaign).

That leaves one hazard #429 also names: `_NAMED.search` and the two
workflows' `sed ... | head -1` both take the *first* match in the file,
not the one under "## Versioning". Today that is the only match README.md
carries, so first and only coincide; the moment a second matching link
is added anywhere earlier in the file -- prose about an older release,
say -- the first-match answer changes to it with nothing going red,
because a stale claim that still resolves to a real tag is not
distinguishable from a current one by shape alone. Keeping the
"## Versioning" link the *only* such link in README.md is what keeps
first and only the same match; a link added anywhere else in the file
that also matches `_NAMED` has to stay below it.

secp256k1-zkp (btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#604) is pinned the same way and
checked differently, because it has no release to name: zero tags at the
pin, so there is no `<tag>^{commit}` for the vendored clone to resolve and
`commit_of`/`why_no_tag` do not apply to it. What README.md declares
instead is the commit itself, as the url of its GitHub commit page, and
the check is a direct string comparison against the index's gitlink for
that submodule -- no resolution, and so no need for the zkp clone to be
checked out at all for this hook to pass or fail correctly. That also
means the hazard two paragraphs up does not reach it: `_NAMED_ZKP` and
`_NAMED` match different, non-overlapping URL shapes (a release tag's
path against a commit's), so one can never shadow the other's first
match.
