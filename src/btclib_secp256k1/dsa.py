"""Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).

A signature crosses this boundary in one of its serializations, DER or
the 64-byte compact form, and `parse_der`, `parse_compact`,
`serialize_der` and `serialize_compact` are what open and close each of
them. They are here for the reason `keys.parse` is: a caller doing more
than one thing with one signature -- asking whether it is low-s and then
verifying it, verifying it against several keys, storing it in the other
form -- parses it once and hands the object to the private halves, where
`normalize`, `is_low_s`, `is_low_r`, `to_der` and `to_compact` each parse
and serialize one of their own.

# neither call, which is worth a hundredth of a microsecond of the 0.278
# the DER serialization costs and of the 0.182 the compact one does --
# 0.012 and 0.006 in the session `xonly.py` names, and not a figure this
# site can be held to between sessions: that comment says why.
#
# The compact width is an int and the DER capacity is not, inverting the
# pairing every other buffer type in this package is built with, and
# `length[0]` is the reason: what `serialize_der` unpacks is the length
# libsecp256k1 reports back, so a capacity above 72 is absorbed on the
# way out and no test can tell it from 72 -- verified, 73 leaves the
# suite passing where 71 fails `test_der_reaches_all_72_octets`. Written
# as an int it would be a number the mutation operator reaches and
# nothing checks, which is the shape `.github/mutation/bindings.toml`
# records as closed, six of thirteen survivors having been it. So it
# stays inside the cdecl, where the width is still stated once and
# `ffi.sizeof` derives the capacity from the buffer's own type -- at
# import, not per call.

    """Return the RFC6979 nonce `sign` derives for a message and a key.

    libsecp256k1 exports its nonce function as a callable pointer, and
    this calls through it with what `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign` passes: the
    message hash, the key, no algorithm tag, and the extra entropy. That
    signing call selects the *default* nonce function, which libsecp256k1
    documents as the same pointer as this one -- an identity
    `tests/nonces_test.py` asserts rather than assumes. So what comes back
    is the `k` of the signature `sign` makes of the same arguments: `r` is
    the x of `k` times the generator, reduced, which is what that same
    file holds it to.

    It is here because a nonce is the one part of signing these bindings
    compute and never show, which leaves a python implementation of
    RFC6979 with published vectors and no oracle. `recovery.sign` derives
    its nonce the same way and this answers for it too.

    **The nonce is the secret the signature is built on.** Read into
    python it has left constant-time code, and a caller that signs with
    one it read here is doing the arithmetic this package delegates
    precisely so that it is not done in python. What this is for is
    checking a derivation, not driving one.

    Args:
        msg_bytes: the 32-byte hash of the message.
        prvkey: the private key, 32 bytes or an int below 2**256.

            None for the RFC6979 nonce alone. Whichever was given to
            `sign` is what reproduces its nonce, `None` included.
        attempt: which candidate to answer. RFC6979 retries when the one
            it derives is not a scalar in [1, n-1], and libsecp256k1
            drives that counter itself; 0 is what it takes first and what
            every signature this package makes has used.

        into: a writable 32-byte buffer to receive the result, instead
            of the `bytes` this otherwise returns. See `_secret.take`
            and SECURITY.md for what that does and does not buy.

    Returns:
        The 32-byte nonce -- or None where `into` was given and holds it.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if the attempt is not an int, if an argument is not

    The check itself is one call, and everything around it is about a
    public key a caller may have handed in. It is taken on trust: a
    signer that derived it to check it would have paid the point
    multiplication the argument exists to avoid, so what is skipped on
    the way in is paid for on the way out, and only where it is owed.

    A key that is not this private key's makes the verification fail, and
    a verification that fails means something quite different -- the
    computation having gone wrong, memory gone bad or a fault induced,
    which is what this check is here to catch at all. Reporting one as
    the other would tell a caller their hardware is faulty because they
    passed the wrong argument. So the failing branch, and only the
    failing branch, derives the key and asks again: it is the rare one by
    construction, and it is where the microseconds saved everywhere else
    are worth giving back.

    What the trust cannot do is let a bad signature through. The keys
    under which a signature verifies are a property of that signature --
    for ECDSA they are what `recovery.recover` walks -- so a key fixed
    before the signature exists cannot be one of them except by knowing
    it in advance.
    `test_a_key_fixed_in_advance_cannot_pass_a_signature_of_another_key`
    is that property rather than this paragraph.

    What it catches that the derived path cannot is worth knowing too,
    because it is more than a mistyped argument. A private key corrupted
    before it was signed with passes the derived check silently: the
    signature and the key it is checked against both come out of the
    same corrupted octets, so they agree. A key handed in came from
    somewhere no fault in this call could have reached, and does not

    The nonce is the deterministic RFC6979 one, so the signature is a
    function of the message and the key alone unless aux_rand32 is given.

    Which serialization to answer with is the caller's, as it is
    everywhere a key is answered: a signature is `r` and `s`, and DER is
    what the wire carries rather than what a caller holds. Asking for the
    compact form is `serialize_compact` in place of `serialize_der`, where
    reaching it through `to_compact` is that DER encoding parsed straight
    back apart.

    `grind` is the one thing here that is more than a libsecp256k1 call,
    and it is Bitcoin Core's `CKey::Sign` scheme rather than an invention
    of this package: signing again, with a counter mixed into the nonce,
    until r has its high bit clear and DER therefore spends no leading
    zero octet on it. It costs what the octet is worth -- two signatures
    on average, and the tail is longer than that -- so it is asked for
    and never done by default. `s` is not ground for and could not be:
    libsecp256k1 has already returned the lower of the two.

    `verify` is the second thing beyond a libsecp256k1 call, and it is
    the other half of that same `CKey::Sign`: the signature is checked
    under the public key of the very key that made it, and one that
    fails is never answered with. What it catches is not a bad argument
    -- those have all raised by then -- but a computation that went
    wrong, a bit flipped in memory or a fault induced on purpose, whose
    cost is a published signature that is invalid and may say something
    about the key. It is the one argument here that is on by default,
    and the asymmetry with `grind` is the point: grinding buys an octet
    of DER, this buys the guarantee that what was answered is a
    signature. Core pays it on every signature and offers no way not to;
    here there is one, because the check is a point multiplication and a
    verification and the caller who has measured that against its own
    threat model is the one entitled to refuse it -- `ssa.sign` refuses
    it more cheaply, BIP340 needing the public key to sign at all where
    ECDSA needs it for neither of the two things `sign` does.

    What that comes to, since "more than grinding" is the useful
    comparison and the sentence above does not make it: 31.67
    microseconds against 12.15, where `ssa.sign` is 28.57 against 15.87.
    So the check is more than the signature it checks, and the 6.8
    between the two increments is the `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` this
    one has to do and BIP340's does not. CHANGELOG.md names the session
    every figure in this module comes from. A caller grinding *outside*
    this call -- signing repeatedly and choosing among the answers --
    pays it once per attempt rather than once, and `verify=False` on the
    attempts with a check of whichever signature is kept is the shape
    that costs what one signature's check costs.

            entropy is not a serialization, and padding one would make a
            caller mistake a valid argument.
        compact: whether to answer the 64-byte `r || s` rather than DER.
        grind: whether to sign again until r is the low one. Refused
            together with aux_rand32: grinding is written into those very
            32 octets, so a caller asking for both is asking for two
            different values of one argument, and Core's counter is what
            makes the result reproducible by anyone else.
        verify: whether to check the signature under the public key of
            the key that made it before returning it. It costs a point
            multiplication and a verification, and False is what a
            caller that has measured those against its own threat model
            passes.
        pubkey: the public key of this private key, where the caller
            already holds it, so that the check does not derive it
            again. That derivation is the larger half of what the check
            costs, and this is how not to pay it twice. It is taken on
            trust rather than checked against the private key, which
            would cost the multiplication it saves; where it is wrong,
            the check says so and says which of the two things went
            wrong. Refused beside `verify=False`, which declines the
            check it is for.

    Returns:
        The signature, in the lower-s form libsecp256k1 always produces --
        DER, or the 64 octets of `r || s` where `compact` asks for them.
