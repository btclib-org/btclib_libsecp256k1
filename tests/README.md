# Vendored test vectors

Where the files under `tests/` that are not this package's own tests
came from, and whether the copy here still matches it. The docstring of
`vectors_test.py` already cites the same upstreams, against `master`: a
citation like `bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340/test-vectors.csv` names
a file that changes under us and says nothing about the revision that
was actually copied. Here each citation is pinned to a commit, and each
blob is compared.

Nothing in this file restates what a vector tests -- `vectors_test.py`
already says that. This says which revision of it is held, and for the
two `secp256k1-py` files the answer is "the same JSON values, ours
reformatted", which the verdict accounts for.

## Reading an entry

Each entry gives the upstream repository, the path in it, the commit
the citation is pinned to, the git blob SHA-1 that was compared, and a
verdict:

- **identical** — the file here and the upstream blob are the same
  bytes.
- **reformatted** — same parsed JSON value, different whitespace.

`pulled` is the date the file entered this repository, from
`git log --follow --diff-filter=A`. `behind` counts upstream revisions
of that path since the pin -- a staleness figure, not a defect: a
vector file is a fixed set of cases, and refreshing it is a decision,
not a chore.

## Re-checking a pin

The commit takes a fence of its own with nothing under it to reach:
written into the path, `trees/<commit>:bip-0340` is a `<commit`
redirection that creates a file named `:bip-0340` wherever the reader's
directory holds a file called `commit`. `${commit:?}` answers the other
paste, the second fence alone, where the value is merely unset:
unguarded, the call asks upstream for a tree at no commit and is
answered `404 Not Found`, which reads as an answer about the pin.

```shell
commit=<commit>
```

```shell
git hash-object tests/bip340_test_vectors.csv
gh api "repos/bitcoin/bips/git/trees/${commit:?}:bip-0340" \
    --jq '.tree[] | select(.path == "test-vectors.csv") | .sha'
```

The comparison is on git blob SHA-1, not sha256: it is what a tree
entry already carries, so nothing has to be downloaded twice. Where
upstream is CRLF and this comparison still holds -- every csv here from
`bitcoin/bips` is the case -- the entry says so, this repository not
being LF throughout the way btclib's is: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`'s
`mixed-line-ending` hook excludes `tests/bip3(40|24)_*.csv`, byte for
byte against `bitcoin/bips` being the point.

### `tests/bip340_test_vectors.csv`

```text
repo    bitcoin/bips
path    bip-0340/test-vectors.csv
commit  200f9b26fe0a2f235a2af8b30c4be9f12f6bc9cb  2023-04-20
blob    672339129a844a060591bb22f444158ff45438ed
pulled  2026-08-01
behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical**, CRLF included. All 19 vectors, all eight
columns. Four of the 19 are messages of 0, 1, 17 and 100 bytes, which
BIP340 accepts and `ssa.sign` does not: those four are what
`ssa.sign_custom` is signed against, the only published values it can be
held to, while `ssa.sign` takes the 32-byte rows. Every row carrying a
secret key is therefore signed and compared byte for byte, and the
32-byte ones twice, once through each function -- `sign_custom`
answering a 32-byte message with the signature `sign` returns is itself
part of what is checked. btclib's own copy of this file takes the
pure-Python path for the same four, having the fallback this package
does not.

pulled  2026-08-06
behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical**, CRLF included. Every vector, all three columns.
The `comment` column names the degenerate case each one is -- `u%p=0`,
`t%p=0`, `u^3+t^2+7=0`, and which of x1, x2, x3 the map lands on -- and
`vectors_test.py` uses it as the test id, so a failure says which case
broke.

### `tests/bip324_packet_encoding_test_vectors.csv`

```text
repo    bitcoin/bips

pulled  2026-08-06
behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical**, CRLF included. Vendored whole, and read in part:
this is BIP324's packet encoding suite, whose later columns are the
ciphers built on top of the handshake. What these bindings compute is
the `in_priv_ours`/`in_ellswift_ours`/`in_ellswift_theirs` inputs
through `ellswift.xdh` to `mid_shared_secret`, plus `mid_x_ours` and
`mid_x_theirs` through `ellswift.decode`. The whole file is held rather
than the six columns, so that the pin above is a pin on something
anybody can fetch and diff.

```

Verdict: **identical**. Every case, the error ones included: an
unparsable key, a key whose x exceeds the field size, a tweak out of
range, and a tweaking that lands on the point at infinity.

### `tests/bip327_nonce_agg_vectors.json`

Verdict: **identical**. Every case; the error ones are all refused at
the parse of the public nonce, which is where libsecp256k1 puts that
check.

### `tests/bip327_sign_verify_vectors.json`

pulled  2026-08-06
behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical**. Read in part, and the part is the verification:
libsecp256k1 has no parser for a serialized secret nonce, by design, so
the `sk` and `secnonces` of this file have no entry point to be fed to
and the signing direction cannot be driven from it. The `expected`
partial signatures are verified instead, which reads the same equation
from the other side. Two of the valid cases -- an empty message and a
38-byte one -- are skipped as well: BIP327 allows a message of any
length and `secp256k1_musig_nonce_process` takes a `msg32`.

pulled  2026-08-06
behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical**. Every case, the tweaked ones included: the
aggregate signature is compared with the published value and then
verified as a plain BIP340 signature of the tweaked aggregate key; the
error ones are all refused at the parse of the partial signature, which
is where libsecp256k1 puts that check.

Not vendored from `bip-0327/vectors/`: `key_sort_vectors.json`,
`nonce_gen_vectors.json`, `tweak_vectors.json` and
`det_sign_vectors.json`. The first two and the last pin functions
libsecp256k1 either does not expose or does not take the inputs of
(`secp256k1_musig_nonce_gen` generates its own randomness rather than
reproducing a published nonce); `tweak_vectors.json` drives signing,
which is the same secret-nonce obstacle as above.

Not vendored from `bip-0324/`: `xswiftec_inv_test_vectors.csv`. It pins
the inverse map, and libsecp256k1 exposes no entry point for it --
`secp256k1_ellswift_encode` chooses a case from the 32 bytes of
randomness it is given, and the case is not an argument -- so there is
nothing here those vectors could be compared against.

### `tests/bip352_send_and_receive_test_vectors.json`

```text

blob    3a189757ddbc90e5ec538d643f7ac238a51704e8
pulled  2026-08-11
behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical**. Every case, both directions of each. It is also
the blob libsecp256k1 vendors, at
`src/modules/silentpayments/bip352_send_and_receive_test_vectors.json`
in the submodule: byte for byte the same file, which is worth saying
because it makes the copy here look redundant and it is not. The sdist
suite job checks out without `submodules: recursive` -- what it exercises
is an install of the published sdist, which carries the vendored sources
of its own -- so a test reading the submodule would silently not run
there.

Read in part, and the part is a decision rather than a limit. Each case
carries its transaction as scriptSig, witness and prevout scriptPubKey
hex, and BIP352's eligibility rules are rules about those; this package
reads no script, so `vectors_test.py` takes the `input_pub_keys` the file
publishes for the eligible inputs and pairs them with the inputs in
order. The one script question left is whether a prevout is P2TR, which
is what decides between the x-only and the full key argument and can be
read off nothing else.

Two shapes of this file are worth knowing before its assertions are
read. A sending case's `outputs` is a list of alternative output *sets*,
not orderings of one: where recipients share a scan public key the
assignment of k among them is undetermined and each assignment gives
different keys, which is why cases 15 and 17 have entries that are not
permutations of each other. And a receiving case's published
`shared_secret` is null exactly where the transaction is not a Silent
Payments one, which is what tells "the recipient skips it" apart from
"the recipient finds nothing in it".

Verdict: **reformatted**. 199 vectors, JSON-equal to the upstream blob;
ours is pretty-printed at four spaces -- byte-identical to btclib's own
copy of the same file, which vendored it independently from the same
upstream.

Verdict: **reformatted**. 199 vectors, JSON-equal, and again
byte-identical to btclib's own copy.

## Summary

Against a pinned upstream blob, in the tree today:

```shell
git ls-files 'tests/*.csv' 'tests/*.json'
```

- identical byte for byte, CRLF included: `bip340_test_vectors.csv`,
  `bip324_ellswift_decode_test_vectors.csv`,
  `bip324_packet_encoding_test_vectors.csv`.
- identical byte for byte: `bip327_key_agg_vectors.json`,
  `bip327_nonce_agg_vectors.json`, `bip327_sign_verify_vectors.json`,
  `bip327_sig_agg_vectors.json`,
  `bip352_send_and_receive_test_vectors.json`.
- JSON-equal, reformatted: `ecdsa_sig.json`, `ecdsa_custom_nonce_sig.json`.

Not vendored, and outside the scope of this file: `vectors_test.py`
also self-checks the RFC6979 `(k, r, s)` triples in its own docstring
against `r == x(k*G)`, which is not a citation to a vendored file, and
constructs the recovery id 2 and 3 signature published nowhere, holding
it to arithmetic it does itself.

## Convention tests

Section 7 of the [organization standard][std] lists conventions a suite
can turn into a red test, and says a repository needs the ones its own
prose states rather than all of them. That escape clause is right and
it costs something: an absent convention test reads exactly like a
convention this repository does not have, and a `grep` over `tests/`
cannot tell the two apart — the suites of the organization name the same
idea three different ways.

So which of section 7's conventions this repository tests is **declared
here**, in two halves that together account for every one of them: the
table below and the "Not tested here" line under it.
`conventions_test.py` asserts the declaration is true, and what its
assertions catch is written in that module's docstring, a second list
here being the statement section 9 refuses.

| convention | tested in |
| --- | --- |
| the public surface | `all_test.py` |
| the copyright header | `copyright_test.py` |
| the documentation | `docs_test.py` |

Not tested here: the import graph; the changelog; the build system;
the calling convention; input validation; the suite opens no socket.

The reasons the rest are absent differ, and are given one by one because
a reader needs which and not how many. **Input validation** is the one
`all_test.py`'s arrival changes without answering: section 7 asks for it
"driven by a walk over the public surface rather than by a hand-written
list", and now there is a walk to drive it from, but nothing here does —
`core_test.py` refuses plenty by hand, against a list nothing checks
against `__all__`. **The calling convention** has no such dependency and
is absent on its own account: two tests read a signature, but each about
one function rather than as a rule over the package.

**The changelog** is the near miss. `vendored_data_test.py` forbids
exactly the count section 7 forbids — a number nothing derives — but of
this file rather than of `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, which is
what that bullet names. The rule is here; the bullet's subject is not.

**The import graph** and **the build system** have nothing standing in
for them: `extension_test.py` reads `sys.modules` to hold an import cost
rather than to establish that every module imports first, and
`wheel_contents_test.py` tests the script that inspects a built wheel
rather than what runs while one is built.

**The suite opens no socket** is absent for a reason the others do not
share: section 7 asks for a walk over the call sites, and there are none
here to walk.

```shell
git grep -lw socket -- '*.py'
```

answers `tests/conventions_test.py` alone — the tuple entry naming the
convention, and no construction that opens one. The same command with
`subprocess` in place of `socket` names the files that start one, which
is the control that the pathspec reaches code rather than nothing. A
walk over an empty set passes whatever the tree does, so what would earn
this a test is a construction for it to walk.

What must not be aligned across the organization is where these live or
what they are called; only which conventions are tested, and that each
tree says which.

## Property tests

Section 7 of the [organization standard][std] keys a property layer on
the property section 10 keys the fuzzer on -- nobody standing between a
parser and an adversary who chooses the bytes -- and section 10's own
paragraph names this tree among those reading signatures and keys off
the wire. The layer is `properties_test.py`, hand-rolled rather than the
hypothesis shape section 7 names, which is what that section asks a
tree to declare here.

What it states are the bindings' own invariants over a sweep of inputs
rather than a few chosen ones -- a serialization round trip returning
what it started from, scalar arithmetic agreeing with the point
arithmetic it corresponds to, a recoverable signature recovering its
signer and no other key, two parties reaching one shared secret, a
tagged hash matching `hashlib` -- and never a second implementation of
secp256k1; each test's docstring names its own. The inputs are derived,
a SHA256 chain seeded by a tag per property, so a failure reproduces at
its exact iteration with nothing installed to generate it, and the
cases the sweep cannot be relied on to reach are pinned by value at the
end of the module, which is where section 7 sends what a search finds.
The malformed half of the domain -- what the parsers refuse -- is
`core_test.py`'s hand-written list, which the section above already
declares as input validation this suite does not drive from a walk.

Hand-rolled because of where the suite runs: `[tool.cibuildwheel]`'s
`test-requires` is pytest and pytest-cov, and `test.yml`'s sdist job
installs those two from pip with no lock, so a layer importing a package
either joins every wheel cell's requirements or fails collection there.
pytest-cov is there for what `--cov` in `addopts` costs -- an interpreter
without the plugin refuses the flag before it collects anything -- and
neither run measures anything with it, both passing `--no-cov`. What the
trade costs is the search: a fixed chain of `COUNT` inputs explores no
further on request and shrinks nothing, where hypothesis's deep profile
and shrinker do both. Bytes outside the described domain are the
fuzzer's question and not this layer's; section 10 is where a sentinel
entry for this tree would be recorded, and btclib-org/.github#342 is
where whether it gets one is decided.
