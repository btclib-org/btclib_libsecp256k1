"""`secp256k1_generator.h`: generators, and Pedersen commitments.

A generator is a second base point, unrelated to `G` by any known
discrete logarithm, that a Pedersen commitment `x*G + v*gen` blinds a
value `v` under. `h()` is the static one the header itself fixes and
`generate`/`generate_blinded` are the two ways to make another; `parse`
and `serialize` are the octet boundary for either, and
`pedersen_commitment_parse`/`pedersen_commitment_serialize` are the same
boundary for the 33-byte commitment `pedersen_commit` builds.

`ISS 608 <https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/issues/608>`_'s
own body names a downstream consumer already pinned against the
x-coordinate of `secp256k1_generator_h`, independently of this library:
`h()` is what turns that pin into an assertion against the library
itself rather than against a copied literal.

Every function here needs `BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP`'s extension, and none
of them reaches for it at import time: `context._bindings()` is where
each defers to it, on the first call rather than on `import
btclib_secp256k1.zkp.generator`, the same reason
`btclib_secp256k1.zkp.context`'s own `__getattr__` docstring gives for
deferring its own `ctx` -- so that importing that module never reaches
for the extension on its own.

`pedersen_blind_sum` and `pedersen_blind_generator_blind_sum` answer a
blinding factor through `btclib_secp256k1._secret.take`, the same
function the primary package's own wrappers use, rather than through a
local equivalent: `take` overwrites through `ffi.buffer(buffer)` and
asks that buffer for its own length rather than typing it, so it does
not care which `ffi` built what it is reading, the same trade
`zkp.musig`'s own module docstring makes for `_secret.wipe`.
