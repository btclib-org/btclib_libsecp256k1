"""Every submodule .gitmodules names is checked out, or check-sdist is blind.

check-sdist (henryiii/check-sdist) compares the sdist hatchling builds
against `git ls-files --cached --recurse-submodules`. That flag drops
the gitlink of a submodule this repository has configured active whose
directory is empty, rather than erroring on it -- and the sdist
hatchling builds is equally empty there, so the two agree and "SDist
matches git" is printed with a whole vendored tree missing from both
sides at once (btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#612). The activation is what
the drop needs rather than the empty directory
(btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1#765): where `git submodule init` has never
run, git lists the gitlink like any other cached entry and check-sdist
fails on it, which is the state a plain `git clone` leaves.

The state this hook is kept for is the active and empty one, and a `git
worktree add` is what gives it: a linked worktree shares the
`.git/config` that `git submodule init` wrote those entries into, so
its submodule directories are active from the moment they exist and
stay empty until `git submodule update --init` runs. Nothing here is
check-sdist's own bug in the ordinary sense: it is told to trust git's
answer, and git gave a self-consistent one for the tree it was asked
about. But the guarantee the hook exists to give -- that the sdist a
user installs carries what this repository ships -- does not hold in
that state.

This hook is what says so, ahead of check-sdist in
.pre-commit-config.yaml: `.gitmodules` names every submodule this
repository has, parsed directly rather than asked of `git config` so
that reading it needs no repository context and cannot be confused by a
git hook's inherited GIT_DIR the way a `-C` call could be
(check_submodule_pin.py's own module docstring has that hazard's full
reasoning). Each path is then checked the same way
check_submodule_pin.py's `_checked_out` does: whether it has a `.git` of
its own, not whether `git -C <path>` answers anything -- `-C` does not
stop git's own upward directory discovery when `<path>` has no `.git`,
so a filesystem check first is what keeps a later git call, in either
script, from silently walking up into this wrapper repository instead.

`always_run`, for the reason submodule-pin already is: the state this
checks -- is a submodule's working tree present -- is independent of
which files a commit touches, so a `files` pattern could never be the
right trigger for it.
