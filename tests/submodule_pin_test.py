"""Tests for the submodule pin check of `.github/scripts`.

The check is a pre-commit hook, so what it says about the real tree is
answered on every commit and in the lint workflow, by the hook itself.
What cannot be answered that way is how it behaves when the answer is no
-- a pin that is not what README.md names, a README naming nothing, a
submodule nobody initialized -- because a tree in any of those states is
a tree the gate refuses. Those are the cases here, built by hand.

There is deliberately no test that the real tree passes the check
itself: that is the hook's own job, and it runs on every commit. The
entry-point guard below is built by hand too, `check.subprocess.run`
stubbed to fail every call the way the rest of this file already stubs
`_git` or `check.subprocess.run` directly, so the guard's own run is as
independent of the checkout's actual state -- submodule included -- as
every other test here.

The script is loaded by path, `.github/scripts` being no package, and
once: `monkeypatch` undoes what each test does to it.
