"""MuSig2, a two-round multi-signature scheme for BIP340 keys.

According to BIP327:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki

The final signature this protocol produces is a plain BIP340 one, over
the aggregate (and possibly tweaked) key `pubkey_agg` computes:
`ssa.verify` is what checks it, and nothing here duplicates that call.

**`secp256k1_musig_keyagg_cache` and `secp256k1_musig_session` have no
serialization**, unlike every other object this module wraps. They
are, in the header's own words, structures with "no serialization and
parsing functions (yet)", so they cannot cross this package's boundary as
octets -- which is the rule the package docstring states for everything
else. #87 declined an opaque *handle* for the reason that "a handle is a
lifetime someone has to own and invalidate", and `_secret.py` records the
clause that reopens it: the handle "belongs where the signing state
lives". A MuSig2 session is exactly that, so `KeyAggCache` and `Session`
below are that exception, taken rather than refused -- refusing it would
leave this module unable to do anything a caller could not already do
through the raw `lib`. Neither object is secret: a keyagg cache is
aggregated *public* keys, and the header says of a session that it "is
not required to be kept secret for the signing protocol to be secure".
So the two are ordinary held state, the third outpost past the boundary
alongside `ssa.Signer` and `keys.PubkeyTweakChain` -- and, unlike either
of those, one this module cannot build any other way.

**A third object, the secret nonce, is the one that must be wiped, and
`SecretNonce` is the model `ssa.Signer` already set for a held secret:**
a `with` statement that overwrites it on the way out, whether the block
ended in a signature or in an exception, and a wiped object that refuses
to sign rather than signing with the zeros left behind. libsecp256k1
already zeroes a secnonce inside `partial_sign` -- "overwrites the given
secnonce with zeros and will abort if given a secnonce that is all
zeros" -- which covers a session that runs to completion. What `wipe` and
the `with` statement add is the session that does not: one abandoned
between `nonce_gen` and `partial_sign`, which the C side never sees and
so never overwrites. SECURITY.md records this as the second buffer in
this package whose zeroing is asked for rather than done, `ssa.Signer`'s
keypair being the first.

**`partial_sign` verifies the partial signature it produces, by
default.** `secp256k1_musig_partial_sign` "does not verify the output
partial signature, deviating from the BIP 327 specification", and its
header recommends verifying it with `secp256k1_musig_partial_sig_verify`
"to prevent random or adversarially provoked computation errors" --
which is BIP340's own argument for `ssa.sign`'s `verify`, on a signature
made from more moving parts than a solo one. `verify=True` is the
default for the same reason it is there: the cost is a verification
against a nonce and a key already in hand, and BIP327 recommends paying
it.

**A parse failure and a tweak failure both tell this package nothing.**
Verified against `secp256k1_musig_pubnonce_parse`: a refusal answers a
bare `0`, through an empty illegal callback, with no message for
`context.check` to raise. `pubkey_agg`, `nonce_agg` and `partial_sig_agg`
all take arrays of already-parsed objects, which the C API's own
calling convention already asks a caller to build -- so `KeyAggCache`,
`nonce_agg` and `Session.partial_sig_agg` each parse their array one
contribution at a time rather than handing a comprehension to the array
helper, and the index that failed is in the `ValueError` because the
loop that found it already knew it.

    """A signer's secret nonce, held between `nonce_gen` and `partial_sign`.

    `nonce_gen` and `nonce_gen_counter` are the ways to obtain one --
    this is never built from octets, there being no parser for a secret
    nonce by design: "Avoid copying (or serializing) the secnonce. This
    reduces the possibility that it is used more than once for signing",
    the header says, and a parser is exactly a way to make a copy.

    What `ssa.Signer` documents about holding a keypair holds here for
    the same reason: `wipe`, or the `with` statement that calls it on the
    way out of the block, overwrites the secret nonce whether the block
    produced a signature or raised. `partial_sign` also wipes it, being
    the call whose whole point is to consume it -- so a nonce used once is
    already gone by the time `wipe` might run again, and wiping a second
    time is not an error, exactly as `ssa.Signer.wipe` is not either.

    A `SecretNonce` told neither is dropped holding the secret, cffi
    freeing the memory without overwriting it: SECURITY.md names this as
    the second buffer in this package whose zeroing is asked for rather
    than done.

    Signing at most once is the whole reason this class exists, and on
    a free-threaded interpreter that has to be true of two threads
    calling `partial_sign` on the same object, not only of one: reading
    `self._secnonce` and then clearing it are two statements, and two
    threads each passing the read before either reaches the clear would
    both go on to drive `secp256k1_musig_partial_sign` over the same
    native secnonce at once, an unsynchronized concurrent access on the
    exact memory a nonce-reuse leak comes from. `_take` is where the
    read and the clear become one statement instead of two, under a
    lock private to this instance -- there being no reason for two
    `SecretNonce` objects to serialize on each other's locks, unlike the
    one shared libsecp256k1 context. Thread safety here is that lock,
    not the constness `ssa.Signer`'s relies on: this is the one buffer
    in the package meant to be read exactly once, where a keypair is
    meant to be read any number of times.

    Args:
        secnonce: the libsecp256k1 secret nonce object `nonce_gen` or
            `nonce_gen_counter` built.
        pubnonce: the matching public nonce object, already parsed.
        pubkey: the signer's already-parsed public key, kept for
            `partial_sign`'s own `verify`.

        Args:

                attributed to, 66 bytes, exactly as it went into
                `nonce_agg`.
            pubkey_bytes: the public key of that signer, 33 or 65 bytes,

                key aggregation came from.
            keyagg_cache: that key aggregation.

            True if the partial signature is valid for that signer's
            nonce and key, within this session.

            ValueError: if any of the three byte arguments is not the
