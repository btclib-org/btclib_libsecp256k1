"""Every module this package ships is documented.

Matching a sibling repository's own tests/docs_test.py: the page under
`docs/source/` is hand written, which invites drift, and telling
contributors to re-run `sphinx-apidoc -f` is no answer -- `-f`
regenerates it from the template,
discarding the myst links to the markdown files. What drift costs is a
module absent from the automodule directives, and therefore from the
published documentation, with nothing anywhere to say so; this test is
the thing that says so.

Simpler than a sibling repository's version in one way: `zkp`, the one
subpackage this package has, gets its stanzas on the same page as
everything else rather than a nested page of its own, so there is no
toctree-entry pattern to
also check. `_shipped()` below needs no case for it either -- a
subpackage's `__init__.py` maps to the dotted package name the same way
the top package's own does, stripping the trailing `__init__` rather
than keeping it as a path component.
